<p class="drop-cap">NIGHT had not been home more than three weeks when he
commenced to get restless and tired of the quiet life on the
farm. It was such a change from the adventurous, exciting
life he had been leading that he did not know what to do
with himself. This going to bed with the chickens and getting up
with the sun, with nothing to do all day long but graze in the pasture
or sleep in the shade, did not suit him; so he whispered to Day one
day:</p>

<p>&#8220;This life is driving me mad. I am going away the first chance
I get. I have it all planned. Come over here by the stream and I
will tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Night, don&#8217;t go away and leave us! It will be so lonely
without you. Why! I think it is perfectly lovely here; it is so clean
and quiet, and then we know we are not going to be hurt or starved
one day and petted and stuffed the next, like we were when traveling.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;I know, dear, but you are a girl and like the quiet, while I am a
boy and like adventures. Why! I like to get into scrapes just for the
fun of getting out of them. Besides, there is another reason why you
like it here. You need not think I have not noticed how that handsome
goat with the long hair and curved horns almost as long as my
own, makes sheep&#8217;s eyes at you, for I have. And so, Miss Day, you
are in love. I see you are blushing, for the inside of your ear is as
red as blood, and that is a sure sign a goat is in love. Well, how do
you like it? It is nicer than you thought when you took me away
from Spotty, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Night! do forgive me. I never would have done it if I
had thought you felt as I do now. But I did not know then; and I
wanted you all to myself. I know I was selfish and jealous, but do
forgive me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear little sister, I will forgive you because I did not care
so very much for Spotty. If I had, you could not have kept me from
her. I would have found my way back to Madeira, if I had spent
the rest of my life looking for it. But you see, don&#8217;t you? that now
you will be happy and contented; father and mother don&#8217;t need me
now that they have you, so I am going out to see some more of the
world and try to find another goat as nice as you are to marry. If I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
do, I will bring her back here and we will always live happily forever
afterward, as they say in the story books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when and where are you going, Night? Do tell me. And
you will surely wait until I am married, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going West. I have heard all about the wonderful prairies,
plains, and mountains out there, where there are hundreds of
thousands of sheep, and how each flock has a large goat for a leader.
Now it is my ambition to be one of those leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world will you get there? It is thousands upon
thousands of miles from here, and you can&#8217;t walk all the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear, I know I can&#8217;t walk it, but I can walk part of the
way and steal rides occasionally, like the tramps do. I will get there
somehow, for I never failed to do anything which I made up my mind
to do if I stuck to it long enough. I can just see those immense mountains
lying so still and solemn, cut by innumerable bridle paths and
ca&ntilde;ons, where the sheep seek shelter from the driving storms, protected
from the wolves that sneak down to devour them by their big
billy-goat leader. He gives the signal of danger and with the shepherd
drives off the hungry wolves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For mercy sakes! don&#8217;t talk of going where there are wolves,
for they will tear you to pieces and I shan&#8217;t close my eyes until you
get back, I shall be so worried,&#8221; said Day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fear for me, sister mine. No old wolf will get the better
of me while I have two such long, sharp horns on my head as I now
have. Why, a wolf is nothing more than a wild dog, and you know
how I treat ugly, cross dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe father will let you go,&#8221; said Day as a last resort
to discourage his going.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he will. He was young once and liked adventures as
well as I do now; and mother won&#8217;t mind after a few days, because
she has you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t mind. Well, I guess she will. Forty me&#8217;s can&#8217;t take the
place of you in <i>her</i> mind; she is so proud of your strength and beauty.
You needn&#8217;t get conceited, but you know you are very handsome with
your silky black coat and long beard, almost as long as papa&#8217;s. Every
young nanny in the pasture has been making eyes at you since you
came back. Why can&#8217;t you fall in love with my chum, Belle? I am
sure she is pretty enough for any goat to fall in love with. And then
you could live here and not go away and leave us all again. I feel it
in my bones if you go you will never come back again. Do try to
live here, Night, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do anything for you, Day, that I could, but I couldn&#8217;t
and wouldn&#8217;t fall in love with that long-nosed, sheepish-looking Belle
with washed-out blue eyes, even to please you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>&#8220;Oh, Night, she hasn&#8217;t washed-out eyes and she is considered a
beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t admire your taste. Whoever wants her can have
her, for all of me. Here comes mother and we must stop talking, for
I don&#8217;t want her to know I am going away until my plans are complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>Night had grown so much like Billy since he had been away that
he was no longer called Night but &#8220;Billy Whiskers Jr.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Jr. had taken to spending all his time by the fence that ran
along the roadside, and he was getting thin from watching so much
and eating so little. When his mother noticed this, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear son, why do you spend so much of your time down by
the road where the grass is dusty and scarce instead of here by the
stream where it is clean and fresh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t mind the dust,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I stay there so that
I can talk to the horses, cows, and sheep that pass by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are getting thin, and your coat is dirty and shabby from
want of care. And you act as if there was something on your mind.
Can&#8217;t you tell your mother what it is that is worrying you?&#8221;</p>

<p>At this Billy Jr. broke down and told her all his plans; how he
was longing to get away and go West; but he could find no one who
could tell him how to get there. All the animals that passed along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
had been born and raised in the East and knew no more of the West
than he did. Nannie answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are just like your father was at your age. I have been
afraid for a long while that you were dissatisfied here; and though
it will nearly break my heart to have you go, still I will not forbid
your doing so.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p012.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>So Billy Jr. kept up his
watch by the fence and at
last was rewarded by hearing
this news: A loose colt
from one of the neighbors
told him that a gentleman
from away out West was
visiting at their place and
that he had brought his
horse with him. This
horse told them all about
the big West every evening
when they were all shut in their stalls; and he, for his part, was
crazy to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I am crazy to hear about for I want to go
there myself. Can&#8217;t you kick the stable door down to-night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
so I can get in and hear what he says?&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I can, for my stall is the outside one, and I will do it
when I hear you bah outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Billy Jr. &#8220;I will be there as soon
as the hired man has left the barn, so he won&#8217;t see me and drive me
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>And for the first time in many days Billy Jr. ate a good dinner
and rolled and rolled in the clean sand to shine up his much neglected
coat, which, when he had finished, shone again like satin. As evening
drew on he was all impatience for it to get pitchy dark and for
every one to go to bed, so he could be off. At last he thought it was
dark enough for him to try it, especially as his coat was so black it
was not easily detected.</p>

<p>He jumped the fence where he and Day had jumped it when
they had returned from their travels and, turning down the road, he
was soon on his way to the neighbor&#8217;s to hear what the horse had to
say about the West.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p014.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Westward Ho!</i></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapb.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BILLY JR. soon found himself at the neighbor&#8217;s, bleating for
the colt to kick down the door. This was done with two
kicks and Billy Jr. walked in and was introduced to the
horse from the West.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to make your acquaintance,&#8221; said the horse. &#8220;I hear
you are thinking of going West and would like to know something
about it and how to get there. I also heard that you thought of
walking and trusting to stealing rides on the cars if you could not get
there in any other way. Now I hate to discourage you but, strong
and brave as you are, you could not do it. You might get as far as
the Great Plains, but these you could never cross. You would die
of hunger and thirst if not with lonesomeness long before you had got
a quarter of the way. Imagine yourself on a vast prairie without a
hill or a tree in sight; the ground as level as if rolled out with a
rolling-pin and covered with sage brush and short buffalo grass,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
coarse as straw and dry as chips; not a living thing in sight but a
jack-rabbit or two and a buzzard flying overhead waiting for your
dead body. This buzzard has been following you for he knows from
experience that it won&#8217;t be many days before you are stark and cold
in death, either from hunger or thirst. Or, if the worst should come
to the worst, you might be torn to pieces by a pack of prairie wolves
as hungry as yourself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes cattle stray from the flock and try to cross the plains
alone and get as far as Dead Lake&mdash;a lake of alkali water that lies
in the desert. This water is as clear as crystal and looks so tempting
to the poor thirsty cattle that they often drink it, though all around
its margin are the bleached bones of other cattle that have drunk of
its poisoned waters and died. One can&#8217;t blame them for drinking,
for it looks so cool and refreshing to them as it lies there clear and
tempting, rippled by the breezes that blow over it. Oh, no! Mr.
Billy, better wait and content yourself here or get shipped through
in a car as I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this gave Billy Jr. some things to think about and he went
home feeling blue and depressed and almost ready to give up his
cherished plans. But next morning he awoke with the same burning
desire to go, and he made up his mind that faint heart never got anywhere
nor did anything, and he decided he would start anyway and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
follow the sun in its direct course west day after day and see where
it would bring him. If it did not lead him where he wanted to go,
it would at least give him adventures, hardships, and pleasures, and
they in themselves were worth going after.</p>

<p>About 11 o&#8217;clock in the morning, while he was telling Day that
his mind was made up to start the next day at sunrise, he looked up
and saw the horse from
the West turn into their
lane with a fine-looking
gentleman on his back.
He ran over to the fence
to see if he could not get
a word or two with the
horse. When pretty near
to him, the gentleman
stopped his horse and
Billy Jr. heard him say:</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p016.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;My soul! but that is
a fine-looking goat. I
would give a hundred dollars to have him West to lead my flocks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, bah,&#8221; bleated Billy Jr., which meant, &#8220;You can have me
for ten cents.&#8221; As the gentleman rode on, Billy Jr. said to himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
&#8220;Oh, why can&#8217;t people understand us as we can them? for then I
could plead with him to take me West!&#8221; And he walked off and
butted an inoffensive goat in his anger and tried to pick a quarrel
with him. But the goat knew Billy Jr.&#8217;s reputation too well and
refused to fight.</p>

<p>Right after dinner Billy Jr. saw Mr. Windlass and the gentleman
who had ridden into the lane that morning coming into the
pasture. He did not go to meet them because he felt cross and disagreeable,
so he stood staring at them, chewing grass like an old man
chews tobacco. However, they came straight up to where he stood,
and he heard Mr. Windlass tell the gentleman how he and the white
goat over there (pointing to Day) had come to him one morning
and he had never been able to learn to whom they belonged or where
they came from, though he had advertised in all the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a black and a white kid a couple of years ago, but it is
not likely they could be the same ones grown up and come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered the gentleman, &#8220;goats are queer creatures.
Mr. Windlass, what will you take for him? I have been
looking for a big jet-black billy-goat to lead my flocks for a long time.
The wolves are getting pretty bad out West on the range and a goat
makes a good leader. I want a black one, as his color would distinguish
him from the white sheep immediately. Besides, your goat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
has other points in his favor; he is strong, large, a good fighter you
say, and has long, sharp-pointed horns. Name your price and I will
take him and have him shipped West in the same car with my horse
when I go. I will charter a car and put feed in one end of it and
have the other partitioned off into two stalls into which I will put the
goat and horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Jr. failed to hear what Mr. Windlass asked for him, but
he heard the gentleman say:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a bargain and I will send my man for him to-night, for I
expect to leave very early in the morning for Boston to catch the
westbound train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah! Papa Billy and Mamma Nanny, come here
and hear what glorious news I have for you. I am going West to-morrow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanny nearly fainted when she heard the news, it was so sudden,
and even staunch old Billy Whiskers shed a tear when he thought
of his gallant young son leaving them, perhaps forever. While for
Day, she just rolled over on the ground and cried, but was soon comforted
by a handsome young goat only a few months older than
herself.</p>

<p>True to his word, Mr. Wilder, the Western gentleman, sent his
man for Billy Jr. just before dark; and when the goats saw him come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
through the gate preparatory to leading Billy Jr. off, they all gathered
round to say a last farewell, and old Billy, Nanny, and Day all
followed him to the gate and watched him with streaming eyes
through the palings until he was out of sight. The man led Billy Jr.
to the depot, and there he was put into a freight-car with the Westerner&#8217;s
pet horse, Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Mr. Billy Jr.! Glad I am to have you as a companion.
You did not expect to have such good luck as this when last I saw
you. You will find this beats walking all to pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly does,&#8221; answered Billy Jr. &#8220;This piece of luck is
beyond my greatest expectations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the train gave a jerk forward and stopped suddenly,
which sent Billy Jr. off his feet, it was so unexpected, and bumped
Star&#8217;s nose against the end of the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never!&#8221; said Billy Jr. &#8220;This is worse than the rocking
of a vessel for knocking one around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the worst of it is you can never tell when it is coming.
If one only could, he might brace himself for it and not get hurt,&#8221;
said Star. &#8220;I hear you have traveled a good deal by water and that
you were once shipwrecked,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me something
of your adventures?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Some day I will, but now I want to ask you questions about the
West.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a half-hour&#8217;s backing, switching, and jerking, the train at
last moved out of the yards and started on its way for the West, with
a bumpity, bump, bump and a clankity, clank, clank. Once out of
the city, it wound itself in and out among the hills and across country
like a huge, brown snake.</p>

<p>In this way they traveled for a couple of days. They enjoyed
the scenery of the Horse Shoe Bend in the Allegheny Mountains,
which they crossed; and they both speculated on what would become
of them if the train rolled from the track in rounding the curve and
landed them at the foot of the mountain thousands of feet below.
Through the slats of the car that had been left open they could see
the country through which they passed, and they stood and looked
until cinders got in their eyes and they grew too tired to stand still.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Collision.</i></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcape.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERYTHING went well until about midnight of the fourth
day out, when Billy Jr. and his companion were awakened
by a terrific crash, a bumpity-bump-bump, and the door of
the car broke from its hinges and fell to the ground. At
the same time there was a noise as if an avalanche of snow were
scraping and rattling on the top of the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose has happened?&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think either we have run into some other train or it has run
into us,&#8221; answered Star.</p>

<p>And the latter is what it proved to be. The freight was behind
time and an excursion train had tried to make the next station before
the freight started out. The consequence was that the excursion
train, running at a high rate of speed, did not notice the freight,
which was behind a deep bend in the road, until it was too late, and
crashed into it. Both engines were thrown off the track and two or
three cars of the excursion train were smashed to splinters, while one
was suspended in mid-air over a deep precipice of the mountain and
the only thing that kept it from going over was the coupling between
it and the other car.</p>

<p>For a second after the crash everything was still; then the cries
of women and children were heard above the noise of escaping steam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
and crackling wood, as fire spread from one car to another and added
its horror to the already disastrous wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy Jr., I smell smoke,&#8221; said Star. &#8220;You are not tied while I
am. Can&#8217;t you jump out and see where it comes from; for if the
train is on fire, what will become of me? I am tied up so tight I can&#8217;t
possibly get loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to pull back and break your strap,&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<p>Star tried, but it would not break.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how; rub your head against the side of the car and
try to slip your bridle over your ears,&#8221; suggested Billy.</p>

<p>Star did this and the bridle dropped off. But he was no better
off than before, for he found himself boarded in his stall away from
the open door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how you can fix that,&#8221; said Billy Jr. &#8220;You kick
with all your might and throw your body against the boards and I
am sure they will give way, for they are nailed on loosely from this
side. While you do that, I will jump out and see what is the matter
and if there is any danger of the fire reaching our car.&#8221;</p>

<p>So while Star threw his weight against the boards and kicked
for dear life, Billy ran forward to see how bad the wreck was.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p023.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>He came upon a sight weird and appalling to the last degree.
The night was inky black, while the flames, as they licked up car<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
after car, lit up the landscape with a red glare like some scene at the
theatre; while for a
background stood the
tall, black mountains
silent and still, like sentinels
around a bivouac
fire. Running hither
and thither were men
and women trying to
save their companions
from the burning train,
and many acts of heroism
were performed,
while lives were bravely
risked to save friend
or stranger wedged in
between the broken
seats of the smoking
mass.</p>



<p>Billy waited only to take one look and then he ran back to tell
Star that he must get out as soon as possible, as the flames were
spreading fast in his direction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>While Star was kicking at his partition with vehemence and
Billy was trying to help butt him loose, there was a terrific explosion
and they felt themselves being hurled through space. The car ahead
of them had contained some gasoline and when the fire reached it, it
had exploded, blowing up the car and the one next to it.</p>

<p>But, strange as it may seem, neither Star nor Billy Jr. were hurt
seriously. Star got a sprained shoulder and Billy a skinned leg, that
was all.</p>

<p>The wreck delayed them thirty-six hours, and while they were
waiting for the wrecking train to come to their assistance, clear the
track, and put the engines on again, Billy Jr. and Star had a fine time
roaming around the mountains and rummaging among the debris;
or rather, Billy Jr. did while Star stood off and watched.</p>

<p>Billy Jr. would nose around among all the broken boxes, packages,
trunks, etc., until he smelt some one&#8217;s luncheon; then he would
eat it up, pasteboard box and all, if he could not get the lid off. At
last he came to the remains of the dining-car, and amongst the wreckage
he found some fine apples and pears. He called to his friend,
but Star felt too timid to come at first until Billy persisted, but after
awhile he picked his way to where the apples were, half covered by
the broken pieces of the car.</p>

<p>While feasting on these the horse felt a hand laid on his mane,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and on looking around to see who it was he heard Pete, the man who
had been sent to take care of them, say:</p>

<p>&#8220;By all that is merciful, how did you and Billy escape from
being blowed to smithereens? I thought ye&#8217;s were both flying around
the dog star by now. But it&#8217;s mighty glad I am to find ye&#8217;s both
alive, for me master&#8217;s very fond of ye&#8217;s both and I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; had
anything happen to ye&#8217;s for worlds while ye&#8217;s was in my care.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pete led Star off and, finding a piece of rope, tied him to a tree
to wait until another train was sent to carry them on, while he sat
down and commenced to smoke, too lazy to help clear away the
wreckage. He let Billy roam at will, for he knew he would not go
far from the horse, they were such good friends.</p>

<p>Presently they heard the purring and blowing of a train coming
up the grade to pick them up and carry them along on their journey.
When Pete heard it he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty glad I am to hear that, for I am as hungry as a bear,
not being able to ate tin cans and raw pertaters like you, Mr. Billy
Jr., and grass and herbs like you, Mr. Star.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train presently reached them, and by the help of many
hands, everything was soon packed on board and they were off for
the West once more.</p>

<p>They did not have any more mishaps and reached Chicago one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
raw, windy morning. As their train pulled into the yard, where it
was to lie until their car was switched on to the Santa Fe train that
was to carry Billy Jr. to the far West, he remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;So this dirty, flat-looking city is Chicago, the far-famed first
World&#8217;s Fair city! Well, I don&#8217;t think much of it from what I have seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you shouldn&#8217;t judge any city by what you see of it from
a train, for remember, the tracks always run through the worst parts
of the city. You should see this city&#8217;s boulevards and parks. They
would make you change your mind, for they are among the finest in
the world. I saw them on my way East, for Mr. Wilder stopped
here a week and during that time kept me at a livery stable and every
day he took a horseback ride. In that way I saw all of the city, its
handsome residences, business districts, parks, and boulevards; and
I can tell you there are none finer, not even in your beloved Boston.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p028.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I could manage to run away and see it all?&#8221;
asked Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless you wish to give up your trip West, for if you once
left this car you could never find your way back among all those
hundreds of others in the yard here that look just like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could easily find my way back if that was all,&#8221; said Billy Jr.,
&#8220;but the thing I am afraid of is that they might start West and leave
me, or switch you off to another yard where I could not find you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Their conversation was interrupted here by a man bringing
them something to eat and a bucket of water.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see why they did not run this car over to the Stock
Yards so these animals could have been taken out and fed and watered
and their car cleaned in proper shape,&#8221; Billy Jr. heard a red-headed
man say, as he pushed back the sliding door that shut them in. &#8220;For
heaven&#8217;s sake! I thought it was two horses we had been sent to look
after and not a car of goats,&#8221; as Billy Jr. appeared at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have the job,&#8221; said a jolly-looking, fat man. &#8220;I throw
up my share right here. I had all I wanted to do with goats when I
was a boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what did they ever do to you that you should take such a
dislike to them?&#8221; said the red-headed man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you. The first thing they did to me when I was
a little shaver was to chew my hair off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chew your hair off! How in the world did they get a chance
to do that?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;It happened in this way,&#8221; said the fat man, &#8220;I went to sleep on
a bank by the side of the road one hot day, and when I woke up my
hair was all chewed off, and the old Billy had commenced on one leg
of my trousers. I stoned him good for this, but he got even a week
after when he met me coming home from one of the neighbors with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
a basket of eggs in one hand and a pat of butter in the other. The
first thing I knew I was standing on my head in the pat of butter
and the eggs were all broken beside me with the basket turned upside-down.
From that day on that goat and I were enemies. He would
do me a mean trick and I would pay him back the first chance I got.
But somehow or other he
always seemed to get the
best of me. And this goat
is as much like him as
two peas; and how do I
know but what it is the
same goat, though that
was years ago? Goats
may live to be a hundred
for all I know, and I
don&#8217;t care to take my
chances; so I will attend
to the horse and you
look after the goat.&#8221;</p>


<p>As these words left his
mouth Billy Jr. made a
plunge for him and, landing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
in the yard clear over his head, ran off and disappeared behind
some freight cars.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what did I tell you! He has got us in trouble right off,
for most likely he will never come back and we will have to pay for
him. Drat goats, I say! and double drat this one in particular!&#8221;</p>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapj.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JUST outside the car yard fence was a Chinese laundry, and
ever since Billy&#8217;s car had been backed into the yard he had
been watching the Chinamen at work at the open door.
So now that he was loose he determined to get out of the yard and
see what it was the Chinamen were sticking their cheeks out with
and blowing on the clothes.</p>

<p>When he appeared at the door it startled one of the Chinamen
so that he let all the water that was in his mouth and which he had
intended to sprinkle the clothes with, fly in Billy&#8217;s face. Now Billy
thought the Chinaman had spat in his face on purpose, and if there
is one thing more than another that will make a goat fighting mad,
it is to spit or even pretend to spit at him.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p031.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>With a plunge forward he butted the Chinaman through a curtained
partition that separated the front room from the back, knocking
another Chinaman that was bending over a washtub into the tub<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
headforemost and
upsetting tub, Chinamen,
and all.
Then he quietly
walked into the
back yard where
some nicely starched
shirts were
hanging out to
dry. These he
chewed until the
two Chinamen
tried to drive him
out of the yard by
turning the hose
on him. They had
only given him
one squirt when
he went for them
and butted one
into a limp heap
in one corner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the room, while the other took to his heels down the street, as if the
old man from the sulphur regions were after him.</p>

<p>On coming out of the laundry Billy Jr. heard Star whinnying
for him in a distressed, excited voice, and he bleated back, &#8220;I am
coming, Star. What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Star answered back, &#8220;Hurry up or you will be left behind; they
are going to switch our car on to the Santa Fe train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy knew he would not have time to go around the way he had
come, so he crawled through a place in the fence where a couple of
boards were off, and gained his car just as it began to back out of the
yard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, old fellow, where have you been? You look all wet, and
you have nearly given me nervous prostration by your absence. I
have neighed and neighed for you until my throat is sore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard you,&#8221; said Billy Jr., &#8220;for I was inside the laundry
seeing to a little washing,&#8221; and Billy Jr. commenced to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at?&#8221; asked Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the funny frightened faces those pig-tailed Chinamen made
at me when they saw me coming for them. I wonder if the Chinaman
I frightened up the street has stopped running yet,&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me so I can laugh, too,&#8221; said Star, &#8220;for I know you have
been in mischief.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>While Billy was telling of his adventure the train started on its
way, westward ho.</p>

<p>The trip from Chicago to Kansas City was made without any
excitement; and after they had left Kansas City behind and were well
on their way across the state, Billy, who was looking out of his peephole,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am glad I took your advice and did not try to walk or
steal rides to the West. I would have been a tired, foot-sore goat by
this time, if I had ever gotten as far as here, which I doubt. The
map of the United States I chewed up never gave me any idea of the
distance between the eastern states and the western. Look quickly,
Star, at that woman with a baby in her arm, coming out of that hole
in the ground. What on earth is she doing there? They don&#8217;t bury
people alive out here, do they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Star laughed and said, &#8220;No, she lives there. That is what they
call a &#8216;dugout,&#8217; and lots of people in Kansas live in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, when I have to live in a hole in the ground I hope I shall
turn into a groundhog and be done with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; exclaimed Billy later, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it getting hot and oppressive
in here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it bodes no good for us, for I am afraid it is the calm
before the storm and that we are going to have a regular old-fashioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
Kansas blizzard or cyclone. Do you see that black cloud rolling
toward us from the northeast? Well, I think that is a Northeaster,
as they call them, bringing a sand storm with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh! how cold it has grown all of a sudden. I feel chilled to
the bone, after that hot, stuffy air we have been having. And see
how it is raining off there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Off there <i>now</i>, but in less than a minute it will be here; only
that is not rain but fine sand that will sting us like needles, blind us,
choke us, and nearly suffocate us before it blows over as suddenly as
it came. I know what they are like, for we passed through one on
our way East.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Star had stopped talking the first particles of sand were
flying and had already shut one of Billy&#8217;s eyes and filled his mouth
with grit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is terrible! Why don&#8217;t some one come and shut our
windows so the nasty sand can&#8217;t sift in? I would not live in Kansas
if they gave me the whole state,&#8221; said Billy Jr., &#8220;if this is the kind of
storms they have here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days later they found themselves in New Mexico in sight
of the main range of the Rocky Mountains, and Star said that by
three o&#8217;clock they would be at Las Vegas, where their journey was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
to end. &#8220;And I shan&#8217;t be sorry, for my legs ache from standing on
them so many days without lying down.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were met at Las Vegas by Mr. Wilder, who had been very
much worried about them since he heard of the wreck they had been
in. But his fears were laid at rest when he saw them, for both had
come through in fine shape and had stood the trip splendidly.</p>

<p>The next morning Billy was tied to a wagon filled with groceries
and provisions for Mr. Wilder&#8217;s ranch, whither they were bound,
while Star with his master on his back galloped ahead or followed
behind as he saw fit. Once when Star was walking beside him Billy
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Star, do you know I feel lonesome for the first time in my life.
When I look at those great solemn mountains, whose tops are always
covered with snow, I feel about as big as a fly and as if they were
trying to teach me a lesson in patience, and dear knows I need it badly
enough. How do they make you feel when you look at them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love them,&#8221; said Star, &#8220;and the nearer I get to them and the
more I look at them the nearer God seems to get. People think
horses, dogs and other animals don&#8217;t know about God, but I guess we
feel His presence more than they do sometimes, though we can&#8217;t talk
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much further is it?&#8221; asked Billy Jr. &#8220;I hate walking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
behind a wagon, taking all the dust from the horses&#8217; heels. And this
dust seems to smart so when it gets in one&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it does; that is because there is so much alkali in
the ground about here. Don&#8217;t you remember my telling you about
Dead Lake and the bones of animals you would see bleaching on its
margin had you tried to walk across the desert? Well, this is not a
desert, but we have to pass a small lake of alkali water, and, small as
it is, you can see the bones of animals lying beside it. There is very
little water out here, no large rivers, and only a few springs or little
mountain streams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! look off there toward the foot-hills; do you see that
grey dog running with a long loping trot?&#8221; continued Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, what of it?&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that is not a dog but a coyote or prairie wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is? I wish I had taken a better look at him,&#8221; answered
Billy Jr.</p>

<p>Presently Star called out, &#8220;Cheer up, Billy. We are almost
there, for I can see the smoke now rising from the ranchhouse in the
distance.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Billy Jr. as
Leader of the Sheep.</i></h2>
</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcape.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">EARLY the next morning a small flock of sheep was driven
from the corral, headed by their leader, an old mountain
goat, who was always selected to take out the new flocks for
the first two or three times and to break in the new leaders. And
now it was Billy Jr.&#8217;s turn to be broken in and taught how to lead the
sheep and give warning of any danger.</p>

<p>He found old Long Hair (so named from his exceedingly long
hair) a very agreeable, patient goat and willing to answer all the new
goat&#8217;s questions, which were not a few, as he wanted to know all
about the country and the ways of Western sheep. Billy knew he
must keep up a certain dignity or the sheep would never look up to
him or have any confidence in him. Soon he was to get their confidence
and a name for bravery in a way he least expected.</p>

<p>Old Long Hair had led them from the corral across the mesa and
down into a valley where a little water was to be found in the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
of an &#8220;aroya,&#8221; or deep ditch, which an Easterner would call a gully.
It is made by the water washing down the sides of the mountains and
plowing its way through the soft soil. When the flock got to the
edge of this aroya, Billy noticed that a large ram with immense
double twisted horns walked out of the flock toward him. But as he
stood looking down into the muddy yellow water thinking to himself
that it would not be fit to drink if he took the trouble to climb down
after it, he forgot all about the ram, until he heard a voice at his side
say:</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p039.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Well, young fellow, what do you mean by coming along with
this flock without asking my permission? I suppose you know that
I am master of this herd and I don&#8217;t need the assistance of any dandyfied
goat like you. When I do, I will select one of my own choosing
and not a stranger and tenderfoot from the East.&#8221;</p>



<p>Billy Jr. laughed in his face and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t provoke me, old fellow, or I may give you a butt that will
land you in that muddy water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You dare to speak to me like that, you&mdash;you impertinent
black-haired goat! If you dare to say another word I will hook
you with my strong horns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you suppose I would be doing while you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
doing that?&#8221; asked Billy. &#8220;What do you suppose I would be doing
with my own long horns about that time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, young impertinence, I don&#8217;t intend to stand here
and talk to you all morning, so be off with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither shall I waste any more time over you, Mr. Puffed-up,
so take that, and that!&#8221; said Billy, as he gave the ram two sharp hooks
in his side and sent him
rolling to the bottom of
the aroya.</p>



<p>When he looked up he
found that all the sheep
had gathered around to
see how the bully of the
herd was going to come
out with the slick black
stranger. Billy made a
bow to them and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not explain to
Mr. Puffer who I am,
but I don&#8217;t mind telling
you all that I am the goat
selected by your master to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
lead this flock, and he brought me all the way from Boston to do it.
He picked me out because he thought I was a good fighter and could
take care of myself as well as protect you from the wolves, which he
said were bad in these parts. Now if any one of you thinks I can&#8217;t
take care of myself and would not make a good leader, I would like
him to walk out of the flock and say so, and we can fight it out while
the rest of you look on and see fair play.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sheep or goat walked out, and from that day until he left he
was the most beloved and admired of all the leaders the flock had
ever had.</p>

<p>The next day Billy, as the acknowledged leader, determined
when he started out not to stop for water at that dirty aroya, but to
push on to the foot-hills and see if he could not find a nice, cool spring,
or at least some water that was not as thick with yellow mud as that
they had drunk the day before.</p>

<p>He let the sheep graze as they went, but he always managed to
keep ahead of them a few steps and in this way they unconsciously
hurried forward and by noon found themselves climbing the steep
sides of the foot-hills of the Rocky Mountains, which in comparison
with the main-ranges seem like little hills.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p040a.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">He Felt Himself Pinioned on a Pair of Long, Sharp Horns.</span></p>

<p>Billy left them to graze there while he climbed to the top so he
could get a view of the surrounding country and see what was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
opposite valley. The sight that met his eyes was beyond description&mdash;in
the distance lay the main range of the Rocky Mountains, deep
blue in color with a white cap of snow on their heads; and shading
down in all the intermediate colors between deep purple, blue and
pale gray were parallel ranges of mountains. Directly beneath him
a silvery stream wound its way through a fertile valley, and nestled
on its banks was a small settlement of adobe houses where lived the
Mexicans that farmed the land.</p>

<p>He had only to turn around and at his back lay an entirely different
scene. This one was grand in its lonesomeness, with its plains
and mesas destitute of trees or life. Out across the barren prairie on
a tableland equally as barren lay Fort Union, now deserted, from
which the soldiers used to ride to fight the Indians. Whichever way
the eye roamed one saw height, space, grandeur which awed into stillness
and made one think of God. It was a silent sermon felt, not
spoken.</p>

<p>Suddenly Billy was rudely awakened from his reverie. There,
skulking stealthily along behind some rocks and bushes, he detected
a moving object that seemed to come creeping, creeping nearer and
nearer to his sheep. He looked again more intently, and yes, sure
enough, it was a wolf he saw making for the flock. In a second the
responsibility of his position, which he had forgotten for a time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
rushed upon him, and with bound after bound he started down the
mountain side. Only a moment he halted to see if the wolf were still
coming, and as he did so, a little white, tender lamb ran on ahead of
its mother right into the jaws of death, for not twenty steps ahead
crouched the wolf ready to spring.</p>

<p>The little lamb came nearer. The wolf crouched on his hind
legs a little more, opened his mouth, and sprang; but instead of his
teeth closing on the tender morsel, he felt himself pinioned on a pair
of long, sharp horns.</p>

<p>But Billy was also surprised to find on closer inspection that his
supposed wolf was not a wolf at all, but one of the half-civilized dogs
from the placita, or Mexican village. It seems that these dogs will
guard their own flocks from an enemy, but will sneak out and eat up
any young lamb that strays from the fold of a stranger&#8217;s flock.</p>

<p>After this the sheep were more fond of Billy than ever and would
go anywhere he led them without a murmur.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>A Fight With Wolves.</i></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcaps.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SEVERAL DAYS after this when Billy was out in the mountains
he noticed that it grew suddenly cold and that light
flurries of snow began to blow and swirl through the mountain
passes. He climbed to the top of a peak whence he could get a
good view of the clouds and saw, advancing from the direction of the
main range, a terrible black cloud that was hurling snow and sleet
on the mountains and valleys as it came.</p>

<p>It took him but a moment to decide what to do, for he knew if
the young lambs were caught out in such a severe storm they would
be frozen to death. So he turned back to the flock and told them to
follow him as quickly as they could and not to stop to take even a
mouthful of grass. He led them into the deepest, most sheltered ca&ntilde;on
he could find and told them to stand close together so as to keep each
other as warm as possible and to be careful to see that the young sheep
and lambs were on the inside where it would be the warmest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Here they stood while the storm raged and blew over and above
the ca&ntilde;on, but the sheep were so sheltered that scarcely any snow fell
on them, as the force of the wind carried it over. It grew darker
and darker and time to go home, but Billy said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We will have to stay here all night. It will never do to go out
in such a storm onto the open prairie. Half of you would perish
with the cold before you got across the valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>So there they stayed in their little sheltered nook undisturbed
until about midnight, when they were startled by hearing the weird
yelping bark of a pack of prairie wolves coming straight down the
ca&ntilde;on. This threw the sheep into a terrible panic, for they knew
that same pack of wolves only too well; they had made raids on them
before and carried off a baby lamb and now and then an old sheep.</p>

<p>Now Billy had never met or even seen a wolf in his life, but he
had absolutely no fear of them, as he knew they were too much like
dogs to be afraid of. Still he did not know how he would come out
fighting a whole pack by himself, and from the sound of their voices
it seemed as if there must be at least fifty of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now all you rams that have horns make a circle around the
sheep, and if a wolf tries to get through in order to get at a young
sheep, fight for your lives and theirs and don&#8217;t give up and run off.
While you do this I will run here and there wherever I think a wolf<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
is most likely to break through your circle and kill them one by one,
for I am not afraid of any wolf I ever heard of.&#8221;</p>

<p>This stand of Billy&#8217;s gave them more courage, but they were so
accustomed to turn tail and run at the approach of danger that Billy
was afraid they would do so now at the first sight they got of the
wolves.</p>

<p>All this time the wolves had been drawing nearer and nearer,
until now only the bend of the pass separated them from the flock.</p>

<p>Soon the yellowish light of seven pairs of eyes glared through
the blackness. This was met by the fiery red light in Billy Jr.&#8217;s eyes.
The trembling sheep dared not move nor look up. Not so Billy!
His eyes fairly blazed defiance, and with a snort of rage he bounded
on the leader of the pack and killed him before he knew what had
struck him. Billy was so black the wolves could not see him; all
they could see were the red balls of fire that seemed to be here, there,
and everywhere, the most deadly balls they had ever come in contact
with, for wherever they appeared a wolf lay dead the next moment.</p>

<p>Billy heard a bleat of agony, and looking to where it came from
saw a dark object in among the white, and knew that a wolf had
broken through the ring he had formed for their protection and the
old rams were deserting their post and running away.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p046.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Come back, you cowards!&#8221; Billy cried. &#8220;You will only be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
killed if you go
out alone.&#8221; This
brought them to
their senses and
they closed in
once more around
the sheep, but left
Billy to do all the
fighting. This he
did with a vengeance
and to such
good purpose that
the wolves commenced
to slink
away, wondering
what kind of a
leader these sheep
had in the place of
old Long Hair.</p>


<p>The next morning
Billy Jr. led the sheep home, thinking it would be better for
them in the corral than out on the mountains until the weather moderated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
for they were not used to such storms in this climate.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wilder saw Billy leading the flock home he went to
meet him on Star and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I was not mistaken in taking you for a born leader. You
are worth your weight in gold. But it beats me where you hid yourselves
last night, for we looked for you and could not find one of you.
And then for you to come back out of such a storm without even a
lamb missing is remarkable. I wonder the wolves did not get after
you and kill some of the young lambs, even if they did not freeze to
death.&#8221; And Billy Jr. wondered what he would have said could he
see the dead wolves lying in the ca&ntilde;on.</p>

<p>Three days after the dead bodies were found by a man from
another ranch when looking for his sheep that had been lost since the
night of the storm and, seeing some small flecks of wool sticking to
the side of the rocks opposite, he knew why his neighbor&#8217;s sheep had
not been killed and his had. He immediately rode over and told
Mr. Wilder, who rode back to see where Billy had fought his brave
battle and saved so many lives. From that day on Billy was the hero
he deserved to be and no amount of money could have bought him.</p>

<p>As the sheep stayed in the corral the next day after the storm,
Billy thought he would try and find Star and have a talk with him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
So he jumped the low wall of the corral and soon found his friend
in the stable-yard chewing some corn husks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Billy Jr.! I am glad to see you,&#8221; said Star. &#8220;I have
not laid eyes on you for ages and I am anxious to learn what you think
of our Western country by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think it is good enough as far as the country goes for any
one who likes it, but I am tired of it and am going back to civilization.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, tired of it already, and with all the honors you have had
heaped upon you!&#8221; said Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t like buffalo grass as a steady diet nor dirty ca&ntilde;on
water to drink. And those sheep are altogether too stupid to suit me.
I would rather live in a city; and that is what I have come to see you
about. I am not ready to go home yet, but I can&#8217;t make up my mind
whether to go to old Mexico or California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear him talk, will you! He talks of going to old Mexico or
California as I would of going into the next pasture. But, my dear
fellow, how do you expect to get there? and are you aware that both
of these places are hundreds of miles from here?&#8221; said Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know they are, but what of that? If I want to go there I
can get there. All I have to do is to wish for a thing hard enough and
I get it. You know I made up my mind to come West, and here I am.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Yes, you are a plucky fellow, and I half believe that if we had
not brought you, you would have carried out your threat of walking
here,&#8221; said Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, I should,&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you want my advice, I would go to old Mexico, as I
think there would be more of interest there for you than in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether to follow the railroad tracks or start
across country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy! You will be the death of me, the way you talk of
our great distances as if they were only a few miles,&#8221; said Star.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes the man to chase me back to the corral and I suppose
he is wondering how I ever got out. I want to thank you for
your kindness to me and to tell you how much I have enjoyed your
friendship, which I hope nothing will ever break. I trust we will
meet again in the East some day. Good luck to you and good-bye
for a time. When I see you again I will have something of interest
to tell you. Good-bye again,&#8221; and Billy bounded over the fence as
the man walked in the gate to chase him out, while Star whinnied
his good-bye.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapo.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE morning three months later Billy Jr. appeared, tired, cold,
and hungry, in front of a ranchman&#8217;s door; and was first
seen by the Chinese cook, who opened the kitchen door of
the long adobe house to see what the weather was like. There was
Billy by the well, trying to get a drink out of the almost empty bucket
on the well-curb.</p>

<p>Billy&#8217;s first thought when he saw the Chinaman was to run away,
for he had been so illy treated lately&mdash;shot at, stoned, and half-starved&mdash;that
he had lost some of his assurance and confidence in people and
preferred to look them well over before he got too near. But the
Chinaman appeared so inoffensive that he stood his ground and stared
back when the man rubbed his eyes to see if it really were a large, live
billy-goat by the well; his first thought being that he had not quite
got over his opium pipe of last night. But when Billy Jr. bleated a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
good-morning to him, he came out of his stupor, walked to the well,
and drew a bucket of water for the tired, thirsty beast.</p>

<p>From that day Billy was a fast friend of the Chinaman. Never
in his life had anything tasted so good and refreshing as that cool
drink of water after his long, dusty trip across the plains and mesas.</p>

<p>For a day and a night Billy Jr. had followed a wagon trail without
passing a human being or habitation, and when he saw this ranchhouse
it was indeed a welcome sight. He was tired, lonesome, hungry,
and discouraged, and he knew that he must go back to the little
town by the railroad, the last settlement he had met with, if he did
not soon find a house and some living thing, man or beast, he could
not endure the dreary solitude another day.</p>

<p>He preferred the town to this, even if the boys did tie tin cans to
his tail, the women chase him with broomsticks or throw hot water
on him when he tried to steal a meal from their kitchens, and the
cow-boys aim at him to see how near they could come without actually
shooting him. Once, when he stopped to get a drink of water from a
trough standing outside of a saloon, the cow-boys caught him and
forced him to drink some beer, which made him feel dizzy and as if
the sidewalk were flying up and going to hit him in the face. And,
oh my! what a splitting headache he had all the next day! It made
him wonder and wonder how people could drink such nasty, bitter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
stuff when they could have pure, clear water instead, and he thought
if they had to pay five dollars a bottle for water, perhaps they would
crave it.</p>

<p>After these experiences, do you wonder that Billy was glad to
find a friend in the Chinaman?</p>

<p>When the potatoes were peeled for breakfast the next morning,
the skins were given to Billy, and they tasted as good to him, after his
long fast, as fresh turnips did when he was living in plenty.</p>

<p>Just as the sun lighted the tops of the mountains, the Chinaman
rang a large bell that hung on a high pole near the well, to call the
cow-boys to breakfast, and as its peals rang out on the morning air it
was answered by the barking of what seemed to be dozens of coyotes,
although, in reality, there was perhaps not half that number; a peculiarity
of their bark being that it seems to double itself and to sound
as if coming from twice as many throats as it really does. Billy did
not like to hear the coyotes, for their dismal cries made him feel both
lonesome and homesick.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast the cow-boys rode off to look after
the cattle and as soon as Billy saw them depart he gave a sigh of
relief, for when they were around they were always plaguing him
and throwing lassos or cracking their whips at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, while the Chinaman is busy with his dishes and the cow-boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
are away, is my time to explore the premises and find out what
things look like around here,&#8221; thought Billy and, seeing an open door,
he walked through and found himself in a long, low room barren of
carpet or furniture, unless two tiers of bunks, a wooden chair or two,
a washstand with a tin basin on it, and a cracked looking-glass, could
be called furniture.</p>

<p>This room was in great disorder. Boots were lying around
everywhere; some in the bunks, others sticking out from under them,
and still others strewn about in general confusion all over the floor;
and where there were no boots there were clay and corn-cob pipes
with half-empty tobacco bags beneath them. None of these things
surprised Billy, but what did puzzle him was that between the windows
there were a lot of holes in the walls which were filled with old
rags loosely poked in, while guns of all sizes and descriptions hung
on the walls or were stacked in the corners of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;This looks like a fort,&#8221; thought Billy, &#8220;but I fail to see who
there is to fight around here.&#8221; But, even as he thought this, he remembered
that Indians lived in this territory, and cold chills ran
down his spine, for although he was only a goat, he had often heard
of the unparalleled cruelty of the Apache Indian dwelling in this
part of the country and he at once realized why this house had been
built with holes in its walls and why all the guns were there. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
case of a siege, the cow-boys barricaded the windows and doors and
stuck the barrels of their guns into these holes, and then they were
prepared to resist an attack and to defend themselves.</p>

<p>Besides the room in which Billy stood, the house contained a
sitting-room, dining-room, kitchen, and a small room that was kept
shut up except when occupied by the owner during his yearly visits
to the ranch.</p>

<p>When Billy had reached this point in his explorations, he heard
the Chinaman calling, &#8220;Bee-lee, Bee-lee, Bee-lee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that means me, so since he makes my name sound so
much like Bee, I will carry out the notion and make a bee-line for
him,&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where-ee you been, Bee-lee?&#8221; said the Chinaman when he saw
Billy running toward him. &#8220;Come-ee long-ee in a here-ee; I have-ee
something good-ee for-ee you-ee,&#8221; and he gave Billy a piece of Johnnie-cake
that had been scorched in the baking-and which he did not
want the ranchman to see because of the wasted meal.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p055.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>While Billy Jr. was eating, the Chinaman threw himself down
upon a wooden bench in the corner of the room, took two or three
whiffs from his opium pipe and was soon fast asleep, dreaming doubtless
of his almond-eyed sweetheart in the Orient. When Billy saw
the pipe fall from his hand, he took first a smell and then a taste of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the powder that had spilled out of it upon the floor; and soon he felt
the most delightful, drowsy sensation stealing over him, and he, too,
curled himself up by the
bench near the Chinaman
and was soon dreaming that
he was back in the old home
meadow with his father,
mother, and Day; but the
meadow he dreamed of was
covered with sweeter clover
blossoms than any goat ever
ate and the breeze that
fanned his face was laden
with sweeter perfume than
mortals ever breathed.</p>



<p>Billy was rudely awakened from this beautiful vision by a vigorous
kick and on recovering his bewildered senses, he found the
room filled with excited cow-boys all talking at once. From their
conversation he soon learned that the Indians were out on the warpath
and were even now within sight of the house.</p>

<p>With wondering eyes Billy watched the boys board up the windows,
barricade the doors, and stick the gun-barrels into the holes in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the wall. Presently, he was driven into the sitting-room and to his
surprise he found that five of the cow-boys&#8217; ponies had also been
driven in here for safety, as the boys well knew that the Indians would
steal them if left outside. He had no sooner entered this room than
he heard a loud bang, and a bullet flattened itself against the doorjamb
just as the Chinaman ran in carrying a bucket of water from
the well; for during a siege, water is a necessity for both man and
beast, and while the boys had been boarding up the windows from
the inside, the Chinaman had been busy filling an old barrel with
water from the well.</p>

<p>&#8220;The red devils are upon us,&#8221; he heard a cow-boy say, and then
the door was slammed shut and he was alone with the ponies. While
the bullets sped thick and fast, and showers of arrows fell, all of
which were answered by the cow-boys&#8217; bullets as they tried to pick
off the Indians skulking around the house, the ponies told Billy
when and how the raid began.</p>

<p>An old roan pony that had been on the ranch for years said,
&#8220;When we went out this morning to round up and count the cattle,
Jim Dowsen, the man who rides me, said, &#8216;Something has happened
during the night, for the cattle are frightened and restless,&#8217; and when
we got near them we saw at a glance what was the matter.&#8221; And he
proceeded to tell Billy about the last raid of the redskins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>The Indians had ridden into the herd during the night, had
stolen fifty head of the company&#8217;s best cattle, and had ham-strung
about fifteen more out of wanton cruelty, because the savage nature
delights in torture. When Jim saw what had been done he was
furious and he rode off like the wind to find the herder who had
been with the cattle. After riding around the whole herd twice
without discovering any trace of him, he at last found him lying face
downward on the ground, his body without arms, his head minus
its scalp. After mutilating him, the savages had left him for the
wolves and vultures to devour, and then satisfied with their fiendish
work had stolen his pony and ridden away. Billy discovered that
the Apache Indians were the most cruel and fiendish of all the tribes
living in the territories.</p>

<p>During all this time the fury of the savages had increased.</p>

<p>Before leaving the ranch, the redskins intended finishing their
work of destruction. They wanted pale faces. They wanted scalps.
But most of all, they wanted fire-water (the Indian name for whisky).
And so the attack lasted for three days or more. Provisions were
getting low within the cabin, the fuel to cook the meals with was gone,
and the horses were neighing for fodder, as they had been fed only
potatoes and cabbage once a day, and then as a last resort, straw out
of the mattresses; and still the Indians skulked outside and waited for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
the little band of men in the house either to surrender or to starve.</p>

<p>The third night of the siege the boys began to lose courage.
Constant watching, loss of sleep, little to drink and less to eat had
nearly worn them out, while their enemies seemed to be in perfect
condition and acted as though satisfied to camp outside their door
for the rest of their natural lives.</p>

<p>At last, one of the cow-boys named Henry Staples said, &#8220;I have
it, boys! I know just how we can get out of here; save our scalps and,
what is better still, kill every one of those fiends sitting outside grimly
waiting to see our finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t buoy us up with a fairy tale like that, Henry,&#8221; they all
said, &#8220;for it is too good to be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen and hear my plan,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You remember that
can of rat-poison we bought to kill rats with when in town the last
time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; they answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let us take that rat-poison and put it in a keg of fire-water;
next, run up a flag of truce, then set the keg with seven or
eight cups outside. Thinking we are offering it in the place of a
peace pipe, the Indians will not hesitate to come and drink. They
are used to poor fire-water and so will be less likely to detect the
poison and will drink cup after cup until they are stupified, and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
end the poison will kill them as surely as it would kill the rats. These
Indians are not any better than rats and should be treated as such.
Have they not tortured and killed hundreds of people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Henry; we can at least try your plan. It seems
the only feasible way out of our plight, and it can but fail.&#8221; So they
blew a horn to attract the attention of the Indians and then hoisted
a flag of truce on the flag-pole at the side of the house where the
United States flag usually floated; and while the Indians were watching
it, the cow-boys set the fire-water outside with the cups on top of
the keg; then, through the peep-holes where the guns had been, they
watched the Indians confer together about coming forward to get a
taste of the much coveted fire-water.</p>

<p>Presently a big buck, evidently the chief of the tribe, walked
boldly forward and took a drink. He smacked his lips and then
drew another cupful, which he swallowed at one gulp. Upon seeing
this, the other braves ran up to get their share, for they did not know
how much or how little the keg might contain. When they found
that it was full, they commenced to dance around in high glee and
they drank again and again as if they could not get enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to shoot every one of them as they now stand,&#8221;
said Henry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said the others. &#8220;Save your ammunition for live
Indians. These will soon be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The chief, who had taken the first drink, was now feeling the
effect of the potion and was becoming quarrelsome. He soon began
to fight with another big Indian and this led to the rest taking sides
with one or the other, and soon all were engaged in a grand melee,
flourishing their weapons in a most reckless and dangerous manner,
regardless of consequences, because the fire-water had gone to their
heads. Presently a young buck, half-crazed under the combined
influence of the fire-water and the poison, started for the door of the
house and tried to batter it down, forgetting all about the flag of
truce, and calling upon the other Indians to follow him and scalp
the pale faces, but, even as their arms were upraised to strike the
door, they were seized with cramps and violent pains. The poison
had conquered at last and soon all were lying around in every possible
shape, twisting and writhing in their death struggles.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p060a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Man Made a Grab for the Greased Pole and down He Went.</span></p>

<p>In less than an hour every Indian lay motionless and the cow-boys
went out to take possession of their arms and ponies. Suddenly
Billy saw an Indian, supposed to be dead, stealthily rise and creep
after one of the boys who was bending over a dead brave unstrapping
his cartridge belt. For a second he saw a knife glisten in the sunlight
and he knew that in another instant it would be buried in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
unsuspecting boy&#8217;s back. With Billy, to see was to act, so without
hesitation he rushed upon the treacherous Indian and tossed him
aside as if he had been a paper ball. The knife dropped from his
hand, for he had been killed instantly. One of Billy&#8217;s sharp horns
had pierced his heart. All the cow-boy said, when he realized what
Billy had done, was, &#8220;Billy, you have saved my life and for this you
shall have a collar of gold, with your name and a record of your
brave act engraved upon it.&#8221; The cow-boy kept his promise, so ever
after Billy wore his collar of gold.</p>

<p>A few days after the siege, Billy felt that he had seen enough of
ranch life and life on the plains, so he decided to return to town and
from there go to some large city as fast as his legs would carry him.
&#8220;For, if I stay here,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;other Indians may come to avenge
those who have been poisoned. They may take a fancy to my horns
to decorate one of their wigwams and may cut my head off, and then
where would I be? Who knows but what they may come this very
night? Anyhow I have seen enough of wild western life and I shall
leave this country right now. There is no time like the present,&#8221;
and with this soliloquy he started on a dead run for town by the same
way he had come and he never stopped to say good-bye even to the
Chinaman.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Billy Jr. and the Firemen.</i></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapt.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next we hear of Billy Jr. he is in San Francisco living,
as his father did before him, with an engine company near
the outskirts of the city. When first we spy him, he and
another goat are stealing vegetables out of the firemen&#8217;s garden.
This other goat is an old fellow with a stubby tail and a single horn,
and although he eats a great deal every day, anything and everything,
from tin cans to rotten potatoes, and has a digestive apparatus like
an ostrich, he still looks thin and shows every rib in his anatomy.
Whether this lean, gaunt, hungry look is because of a guilty conscience
or the result of ill-usage, I know not, but I do know that he
is the homeliest goat any one ever looked at.</p>

<p>Bang! goes a gun and the next minute four pairs of legs are flying
over the garden fence. &#8220;There, I told you we could not steal
safely in broad daylight,&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p063.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I hope you don&#8217;t mind a little scare like that,&#8221; answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the old goat. &#8220;Why,
my sides are full of
bullet holes. They
are always firing at
me, but I simply caper
round and round
until they pick the
shot out, for it only
goes in skin deep.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Well, I can tell
you I don&#8217;t care to
have <i>my</i> sides peppered
like that,&#8221; said
Billy; &#8220;and, too, a
bullet might go
astray and put out
one or both of my
eyes. But here comes
that fireman I so detest. Let us run and hide. I shall get even
with him some of these fine days when he least expects it, for he is
always cutting me with that fine-lashed whip that hangs in the
engine-house. I don&#8217;t care how much he tries to club me, for I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
fight, butt, and run, besides when he has a club in his hand he is
obliged to come close in order to hit me, so that gives me a chance
to butt him, but a long-lashed whip is a very different matter. It
winds itself about one before he knows what is coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, have a grudge against that particular fireman,&#8221; said old
One-horn, as the boys had nicknamed the other goat, &#8220;and if you can
get even with him I shall be your friend for life, for it was through
him that I lost my horn and you know it is as bad for a goat to lose a
horn as it is for a man to lose a leg. Come and lie here in the shade
while I tell you how I lost my horn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That fireman,&#8221; the old goat continued, &#8220;had been persistently
mean to me for weeks; had put red pepper in my food until my
tongue was nearly burned out, had shaken snuff under my nose and
on my beard until I had almost sneezed my head off, had turned the
hose on me until I was half frozen, and had annoyed me in a hundred
other petty ways, until I felt that I could kill him with a clear
conscience if I ever got the chance. He was the largest of the firemen
and a champion boxer, but I was not afraid of that and resolved
to watch for an opportunity when I might catch him alone and then
pay him with compound interest for all the mean tricks he had played
on me. One day I was lying here in the shade half-way between
sleeping and waking when I saw him come out of the engine-house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and start to cross the vacant lot you see before you, for his home is
on the other side. He was half-way across when the thought struck
me&mdash;<i>now is my opportunity</i>. He was alone and carried nothing to
protect himself with, so I jumped up and ran quietly behind him,
the soft turf deadening all sounds of my approach, and he never
suspected that I was near him until I gave him a vigorous butt that
was the master-stroke of my life. It sent him flying six feet or more
straight in the air. When he struck the ground he lay perfectly
motionless for a moment with the breath knocked completely out of
him. He was only stunned, however, for he soon raised his head
and, seeing me, shook his fist and fairly roared, &#8216;You confounded
old goat, I&#8217;ll break every bone in your old carcass for this.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intended to let him alone after that, for I thought he had
been punished enough, but when he shook his fist and threatened
me, I was mad all over and I lowered my head and would have
butted him again had he not caught me by the horns, at the same time
giving my head a twist with his great muscular arm, that nearly
broke my neck. This made me furious, and I stamped and kicked
and tried to get my horns loose, but he held me tight, well knowing
that it was dangerous to let me go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we rolled and tumbled about in the mud until we were
both nearly exhausted, and at last he loosened his hold of my horns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
at the same time giving me a parting blow on the head that made
me see stars for an instant. In the meantime he started for home
on a dead run, and as a matter of course I lost no time in following
him, but I did not catch up until just as he was entering the front
door of his home. Then I aimed straight for his coat tails, but he
shut the door with a bang, catching my horns between it and the jamb;
then he pushed with all his might and main from the inside, while I
too pushed with all my strength from the outside, hoping to splinter
the panel of the door, but instead, I broke my horn, and that is how
I lost it and why I owe him a grudge.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the back yard of the engine-house stood a pump with a tub
of water under its spout. Billy Jr. went to get a drink from it and,
while quenching his thirst, heard one of the firemen say to two
others standing in the yard, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you can&#8217;t do it, though every
one knows he needs it badly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s easy enough to wash him,&#8221; they answered, &#8220;the difficulty
will be in untying him after it is done, for then he will butt the
life out of the first man he catches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s draw cuts to decide who is to do the untying,&#8221; said a third.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; they answered; and before Billy even suspected
what they were talking about, he found himself bound and tied to
the pump so that he could only move his head slightly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;So, it was me they were talking about,&#8221; thought poor Billy.
&#8220;Had I only known, they would have had a fine time catching me,
and more than one man would have had bruises and torn clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; he thought a moment later, &#8220;but this water is cold
that they are pumping upon me, and won&#8217;t I get even with them all
when I get loose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; cried one of the men, for Billy suddenly tossed his head
giving him a bump on the nose. Then two of the men began to use
brushes, one on each side, while a third kept the pump going; so,
squirm and wriggle as he might, Billy got a generous supply of
water and was drenched and shivering in spite of his efforts to free
himself.</p>

<p>At last the firemen thought he was clean enough and they
stopped scrubbing, while one of them said, &#8220;Well, Billy Jr., how do
you find yourself?&#8221; Billy glared at him and shook his head in answer,
but there was murder in his eye.</p>

<p>Next the men drew cuts to decide who should untie him and,
strangely enough, it fell to the lot of the fireman who was always
cracking his whip at Billy and tormenting old One-horn. When
this man found that he was to untie Billy, he said, &#8220;Very well, boys,
you all get inside of the engine-house and shut the big door, leaving
the little one open for me to run through, but be sure to shut it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
quickly behind me or Billy will be inside as quickly as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; they answered, and away they went to do as bidden.
Then the fireman who was to do the untying, approached cautiously
and first untied Billy&#8217;s legs, leaving his head still tied to the pump;
then with a sharp knife he cut the last cord with one swift slash and
ran for the engine-house. Quick as he was, our Billy was not far
behind, for with one bound he covered half the distance that lay
between them while with another he went bang against the little door
through which the fireman had but just disappeared.</p>

<p>The door was slammed shut in double-quick time, and had
Billy&#8217;s head not been a hard one it must surely have split in two when
it struck the door. However, it was made to withstand hard knocks
and so, undismayed, he backed off to gather impetus for another rush;
and then with a last plunge he split the door from top to bottom and
landed in a confused heap right in the midst of the astonished firemen,
who scrambled in all directions with more haste than grace,
thinking only of getting out of reach of Billy&#8217;s avenging horns. One
man climbed up on the high seat of the fire-engine, another ran down
cellar, while the third, the particular one Billy was after, bounded
up the stairs that led to the firemen&#8217;s bedroom, in which was an open
hole with a greased pole coming up through the middle for the firemen
to slide down when an alarm of fire was sent in. Billy was up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the stairs and into the room almost as soon as the man himself, who
in mad haste made a grab for the greased pole and down he went,
leaving Billy rather doubtful as to what course to pursue; but quickly
seeing the impossibility of a goat&#8217;s trying to slide down either a
greased or any other kind of a pole, he bounded down the stairs again.
The firemen had to all appearances disappeared, but Billy sniffed
the air suspiciously and, glancing keenly first in one direction and
then in another, he soon discovered his pet enemy seated on the hook-and-ladder
wagon. This elevated position he wisely forebore attempting
to reach and, instead, took up a position where no one
could enter or leave the engine-house without passing him, and then
he calmly laid himself down and waited.</p>

<p>But the fates were against Billy Jr. and he was obliged to give
up his position or get run over. Just as he got comfortably settled,
the fire alarm rang out and each well-trained horse rushed to his
allotted place on engine, hose-cart, or ladder-wagon. As Billy saw
the engine speed away with his enemy holding on behind and trying
to get into his rubber coat, he said, &#8220;I have been cheated of my revenge
to-day, but look out for to-morrow, you red-faced lubber,&#8221;
and with this parting threat he trotted off to find his friend, old One-horn.</p>

<p>Just as Billy was coming out of the engine-house he came upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
an old German couple leading a dainty little Nanny-goat by a string.
Now, it had been a long time since Billy had met a pretty Nanny
and his heart fairly thumped with joy as he pranced up to make
friends with her, but here is where he made a mistake. In his joy
at seeing her pretty face he had forgotten that he must needs be introduced
before approaching a strange Nanny, and this young thing
proved to be unusually timid, so when she saw a big strange Billy-goat
running toward her as if he had known her since she was a
baby kid, she promptly dodged behind her mistress. Billy, nothing
daunted, followed after her. As his head appeared at one side of
the old fat woman, Nanny&#8217;s appeared at the other, and the faster
she ran the faster he followed. This they kept up until the poor
woman was wound round and round by the cord, so that she could
not move and, being equally as timid as her little charge, she at last
fainted and fell forward on the walk, knocking Billy off of his feet
and throwing Nanny down upon her knees. When Billy saw the
mischief he had been the cause of, and also saw the old woman&#8217;s
husband coming after him with a thick club, he wisely disappeared
round the first corner, pondering in his mind over the foolishness
of young kids in general and of this one in particular.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE night before Christmas, Billy Jr. was prowling around,
feeling lonely and unhappy and wishing that he were back
again with his father and mother for the holidays at least.
Chancing to look through a window from which the light was
streaming, what should he see but a beautiful Christmas tree! And
more wonderful still, who do you suppose was trimming it? None
other than old Santa Claus himself. Billy quickly stationed himself
directly in front of the window and gazed with longing eyes upon
the many attractive gifts being tied upon the tree. &#8220;Oh, my! Just
wouldn&#8217;t I like to get a nibble at that big red apple hanging near
the very top of the tree. Yes, and there is a fine cornucopia filled
with all kinds of goodies that I could eat if I had the chance, and
without a grain of salt, either.&#8221; But Santa Claus continued his
work, utterly unconscious of the greedy eyes blinking at him from
the outer darkness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Presently Billy Jr. said, &#8220;I wonder whose house this is and how
many children live here.&#8221; Almost as if in answer to his question a
quick step sounded on the walk, and to his utter disgust, the hated
fireman ascended the steps and entered the house with his latch key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I declare,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;it&#8217;s a shame for a man like that to
have such a lovely Christmas tree. I&#8217;ll venture to say that Santa
Claus does not know how unkind he is to animals or he would never
help him to trim his tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the last gift was disposed of, Santa Claus raised the
window to keep the room cool so that the tree might not wilt, then
he quickly put out the lights; and hark! I hear sleigh bells! Yes,
there he goes with his reindeer over the tops of the houses. Swiftly
and merrily he drives, stopping at every fireside to bring joy and
some little remembrance of his good will to all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that he has gone and the window is open, what is to hinder
me from climbing in and tasting a few of the Christmas dainties?
I am sure a few would not be missed and I can see my way clearly,
as that electric light across the street shines straight into the room,
making it as light as day. There is a packing box just under the
window that I can jump upon, and from that I can easily get into
the window.&#8221; So, without any more ado Billy climbed in and at
once began to eat the dainties he had coveted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>The first thing he took was the big red apple, then the cornucopia
of nuts and candies, next he licked a lemon-candy dog, after
this he ate a popcorn ball or two, then he spied a bunch of yellow
carrots on an upper branch. These he <i>must</i> have (not knowing that
they were made of silk and to be used as a pin cushion). So he
raised himself on his hind legs and tried to reach them, but they
were <i>just</i> beyond his nose. He gave a little spring, but missed
again, and, worse still, his feet struck the table which the tree stood
upon and over it went, burying the luckless Billy under it, while tin
horns, candies, toy horses, and all, rattled round him in hopeless
confusion. The noise awoke the fireman, and he and his wife came
hurrying into the room, thinking to find burglars. They did not see
Billy, for as they opened the door he jumped out of the window, and
to this day they do not know <i>who</i> upset the Christmas tree.</p>

<p>One day when Billy was wandering idly about he saw one of
the firemen walking across lots, carrying a bundle which he knew
was intended for the washerwoman. Having nothing special to do,
he followed and soon overtook him. The fireman gave him a chew
of tobacco and was surprised to find that instead of spluttering, making
a fuss, and spitting it out of his mouth, he chewed it like an old-timer
and seemed to enjoy it, his beard going up and down in that
queer way that men&#8217;s do when they are chewing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;Well, Billy, how are you, and how has the world been using
you since last we met? Let me see, the last time I saw you, you
were trying to decide whether to come down a flight of stairs or
whether to slide down a greased pole, were you not?&#8221; And with
such pleasant converse the man and goat walked along side by side
until they reached the washerwoman&#8217;s shanty. She was a jolly, red-faced
Irishwoman, somewhat pie-crusty in temper, but nevertheless
an excellent laundress, and all would have been well had not Billy
accidentally tramped with his muddy feet on some fine clothes that
had been spread on the grass to whiten. Seeing his footmarks upon
the dainty pieces with which she had taken such pains, she snatched
up a dipper of hot water and threw it at Billy, calling out as she
did so:</p>

<p>&#8220;You miserable baste, if ye come around here with your dirty
fate again, a-spilin&#8217; my nice, clean clothes, I&#8217;ll brake yer ugly neck
fer ye, that I will. Bedad it&#8217;s no fun doin&#8217; thim fine petticoats agin.
Sure and it ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our Billy Jr., having the grace to see that he was at fault, and
that his carelessness had been the cause of making unnecessary work
to the irate Irishwoman, meekly turned away and returned home
without waiting for the fireman.</p>

<p>The next day Billy thought he would stroll back to the washerwoman&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
place to find out if she were still angry with him, and also
to play some trick upon her (if he could) in return for the throwing
of the hot water. He first peeked through a crack in the fence to
see if she were hanging out clothes, but not seeing her, he crawled
through a hole where some boards had fallen down and, keeping a
sharp lookout about him, he caught sight of her coming from the
kitchen. He kept out of sight until she disappeared within a neighbor&#8217;s
house, then he walked straight to the kitchen door, stuck his head
inside and, as no one was about, he boldly walked in to see if he
could find what it was smelt so good. He had not far to look, for
just before him stood a table, and on it was placed the mid-day meal
which the washerwoman had prepared for her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but it smells good and I am as hungry as a bear,&#8221; and
Billy, without a twinge of conscience, helped himself to the nice,
mealy potatoes, cabbage and cornbeef, and the bread, even licking
the crumbs from the plate, and leaving only the empty dishes for the
poor hungry husband.</p>

<p>Just as he was taking a last reluctant lick at the cabbage plate,
he heard some one coming and, in turning quickly to escape, he upset
a clothes-horse full of clothes so that they fell upon the stove, where
they soon caught fire, and the flames spreading to the woodwork of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
the shanty, the whole structure was in a blaze before you could say
Jack Robinson.</p>

<p>Billy escaped without even singeing a hair and started on a
dead run down the block. When he finally turned to look back,
flames and smoke were pouring from windows and doors, while the
poor laundress stood in the yard wringing her hands in sore distress,
and watching all her earthly belongings go up in smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; said Billy; &#8220;I did not mean to burn her home; I
only intended to annoy her and eat her husband&#8217;s dinner; but, never
mind, there go the firemen to the rescue. They will soon put out
the flames,&#8221; and with a whisk of his tail Billy ran off to look for more
mischief.</p>

<p>Billy was growing tired of the location in which he lived, so he
decided to leave the firemen and seek a more fashionable quarter of
the city, consequently he selected Knob Hill as being quite to his
liking. When the firemen went to feed Billy, one morning, he was
nowhere in sight. They whistled again and again, but there was no
response. He came neither to luncheon nor to supper, but the men
thought nothing of this, as he often absented himself for a day or
two at a time, but when three, four, five, and six days passed and
still Billy did not make his appearance, they felt sure that he had
been stolen or had wandered off and been shut up in some barn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
They waited a day or two and finally advertised for him by nailing
up a large red poster illustrated with a handsome black goat, and
offering a liberal reward for his return or for information as to his
whereabouts.</p>

<p>Billy laughed way down in his whiskers when he saw the gorgeous
poster and the representation of himself, and then he walked
up and tore it off the boards. But while in the act of doing this he
was recognized by a lot of boys as the goat advertised for, and they
quickly pursued him, hoping to claim the reward offered. Need
we say that before they had finished with Billy they wondered who
in the world could want such a goat? As for themselves, they would
have been glad to pay to get rid of him.</p>

<p>Two boys finally got a rope around his neck and thought themselves
wonderfully smart for doing so, but they little dreamed that
our Billy had allowed them to do it for a purpose of his own. As
soon as the rope was securely tied and the boys had a tight hold of
the ends, he started, and now the fun began.</p>

<p>Billy was a sturdy fellow, possessed of a certain grim sense of
humor, so in a seemingly guileless, innocent manner he lowered his
head and trotted along at a steady gait, choosing all the rough, stubbly
places in the road, never missing a mud-hole, never passing an
ash heap; through the one, over the other he went, dragging the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
boys after him, and when they attempted to hold him back or to
stop him, he simply quickened his pace and went flying through
narrow alleys, over and amongst heaps of rubbish, jerking them to
their feet at times, or upsetting them with scant ceremony, as the
case might be, so that finally rope and boys became hopelessly entangled,
and the boys could not let go if they would, but were completely
at Billy&#8217;s mercy. But, at last, the rope got twisted around a lamp-post
and then it broke, giving the boys their liberty very suddenly.
By this time they had lost all thought or desire for a reward and
Billy left them with a satisfied twinkle in his eye and a subtle smile
well hidden under his long whiskers.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON his way back to Knob Hill, Billy passed a magnificent
mansion with shades down and the gas lighted inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what in the world is the matter with the people
who live there?&#8221; he mused; &#8220;are they lunatics that they close the
curtains, shut out the sunshine, and then light the gas at three o&#8217;clock
in the afternoon? And what is that long tunnel-like, canopied passage
that extends from the curbing to the front door? I believe they
call it an awning. It is not raining, what do they want it for? I
must get nearer and see about it.&#8221; So Billy walked to the side opening
in the awning and looked in. The front door of the house was
wide open and he could hear the strains of a mandolin orchestra
from within, while the perfume from many flowers was wafted to
his nostrils. Not a person was in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;How strange,&#8221; thought Billy, &#8220;to leave a front door wide open
and no one to watch it! Guess I will walk up and see how it looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
inside.&#8221; Accordingly he walked bravely up to the door and looked in.</p>

<p>Such gorgeousness he had never even dreamed of. There were
flowers and palms in bewildering profusion. There were draperies
and furniture of Oriental magnificence, and hundreds of electric
bulbs with shades of varied colorings which lit up the scene, while
soft, dreamy music made one feel as if he were indeed in fairyland.
As in a dream Billy walked up the broad flight of stairs leading to
the second floor and from the first room to the right he could hear
voices and subdued laughter, while from an adjoining room came
the admonition, &#8220;Girls, stop chattering and finish dressing, for your
guests will soon be here.&#8221; Then Billy knew that an afternoon reception
was to be held here and that was why the shades were drawn
and the gas lighted; for it is not fashionable to have sunlight at these
affairs. Complexions and gowns look better by gaslight.</p>

<p>When Billy heard the voices, he turned and walked into the
front room. This apartment was furnished in keeping with the magnificence
of the parlor floor. White woodwork, mahogany chairs
and table, a high four-poster bed with satin and lace coverings, silver
toilet articles on the dresser, silver and cut glass vases everywhere
filled with pink roses and white hyacinths, and again, a multitude
of soft-tinted lights which enhanced the beauty of everything the eye
rested upon.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p080a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Billy Gave One Leap which Carried Him ahead of the Dog.</span></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;The scent of the flowers reminds me of the clover in the
meadows. I must have a taste of them.&#8221; So Billy tasted and then
ate one entire bouquet, for the flavor was so fine he could not stop at
one bite. Then, beginning to feel the effects of his wearisome escapade
with the boys, and lulled by the warmth, light, perfume, and
music surrounding him, he jumped up in the middle of the beautiful
bed, and stretched himself out on the exquisite pink satin and lace
coverlet preparatory to enjoying a good rest. Nothing was too good
for the use of Billy Jr.</p>

<p>When the first guests entered the room they scarcely glanced at
the bed, going first to the mirror to adjust their hair and repowder
their noses. Suddenly, one of the ladies dropped the comb with a
clatter, her eyes nearly dropping from their sockets and her face
blanched with surprise and fear, for, reflected in the mirror, she
saw two long horns suddenly raised from what she had supposed to
be a black fur coat, and, screaming at the top of her voice, she turned
and stood staring with open-eyed wonder at the sight before her.
Her screams brought the entire household scrambling to the scene.
She could not explain but dropped into a chair, completely overcome.
Words, however, were needless, for there stood Billy in the
middle of the great four-poster, self-convicted, and quite as surprised
as any of the onlookers. For a moment he did not know which way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
to turn, but finally,
seeing a door opposite
the one in which
the people all stood,
he jumped for that
and from there made
his escape into a
small room which
connected with the
hall. Down the
steps he went, upsetting
the fat butler
with whom he came
in contact on his way
down and, without
pausing to offer his
apologies, hastened
into the street and
hurriedly left the
neighborhood.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p082.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The goat episode was the main topic of conversation that afternoon
among the fair five hundred, and Billy would have been flattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
could he have heard himself described as &#8220;fierce-looking as a lion and
as large as a bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Billy Jr. left the house where the reception was being held,
he wandered around not knowing where to go. He began to feel lonesome
and hungry and almost wished he had stayed with the firemen
and old One-horn, even if his life with them was a monotonous one.</p>

<p>Presently, all thought of lonesomeness and hunger was driven
from his mind by the sight of some boys coming around the corner
whipping a large St. Bernard dog that was hitched to a little cart.
When they saw Billy, they cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, see the dandy goat. Let&#8217;s catch him and hitch him up to
your cart, Ned, and have a race. What do you say, is it a go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better let them catch you, stranger,&#8221; barked the dog,
&#8220;or they will club and beat you when they do get you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until I have given them a chase,&#8221; bleated the goat, and with
that he stood as if he were going to be an easy catch, until they tried
to put their hands on him. Then he stood on his hind legs and whirled
round and round like a circus-goat, facing them all the time between
the whirls, so the boys did not know how to get hold of him in this
position, besides they were afraid he would butt or kick them.</p>

<p>All this pleased the dog immensely and he laughed until his sides
shook. Presently, Billy Jr. heard cart-wheels on the sidewalk and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
he knew Ned was returning with his cart. As the boy approached,
Billy Jr. converted his hind legs, which he had been using as stilts,
into kickers. Then with a bleat that meant &#8220;Oh, no you don&#8217;t,&#8221; he
jumped over the low iron fence beside which he was standing and
disappeared round the corner of a big brown-stone house that stood
in the middle of a large yard, while, of course, all the boys came tagging
after. Hero, the St. Bernard dog, forgetting the wagon he was
hitched to, jumped too, breaking loose as he went over the fence.</p>

<p>As Billy rounded the corner of the house, he ran into the laundress,
who was carrying in her arms a big basket of clothes piled so
high that she could not see what hit her, until she found herself flat
on the ground with her basket overturned beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, see what yees have done wid yer ugly black goat a-goin&#8217;
and upsetting all me clane clothes, and the missis that particular as
never was. Bad luck to yez. Take him away,&#8221; she called, as she
saw Billy coming toward her again. Billy expected to run round the
house and come out on the street, but he was unable to do so, as the
opposite side of the yard was enclosed by a high fence which he could
not jump; and here the boys cornered him. He was going to butt
them and get away, but the St. Bernard barked to him to let himself
be caught and then they could have a race and see which could run
the faster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>When Hero proposed this he, of course, thought he could beat
Billy and not half try, or he would not have suggested it. Billy Jr.,
on the other hand, was sure he could beat Hero, so he let himself be
caught and led into the front yard where he was soon hitched to Ned&#8217;s
cart, while Hero was re-harnessed and hitched to another by Will,
his master.</p>

<p>Soon the dog and goat were ready for the race and they were led
into the middle of the street, Ned and Will each in their respective
carts, and the other boys standing around ready to follow them when
they started. A boy stood at the head of each animal, letting go when
the word was given. Both the goat and the dog started at such a pace
that the boys lost their hats and came near being thrown backwards
out of their carts. Billy gave one leap which carried him
ahead of the dog and jerked the cart along on its back wheels. Away
down the street they sped, dodging wagons whose drivers stopped and
stuck their heads out at the sides to see the fun. Hero, who was fat
and short winded, seeing that he would have to do his best, ran with his
tongue hanging out of his mouth, panting for breath, while Billy Jr.,
who was slender and in fine condition, closed his mouth and ran
swiftly as an antelope, coming out way ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for you, Billy! I shall take you home with me and
keep you, for I consider you a good friend and you shall have the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
supper you have had in a long while.&#8221; Billy Jr. bleated his thanks
and added that it could not be given to him any too quickly, as he was
both hungry and thirsty. &#8220;Before I go I want to tell Hero that I
would like to have another race with him some other day when he is
in better trim, for I beat him too easily this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hero thought Billy was bragging about his victory, so he said
the reason he had not beaten was because his collar was so tight that
he could not get his breath. &#8220;Besides,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Will is much
heavier than Ned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you think that is the reason,&#8221; said Billy Jr., &#8220;come out
to-morrow and I will run you a race without any carts for a couple of
miles instead of one, and then we shall see who will win.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all the conversation they had, for Ned led Billy off,
fearing the other boys might want to take him away from him. They
said he had no more right to the goat than they had, as he was evidently
a stray goat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Ned, &#8220;but none of you fellows have a
wagon, so I guess I will keep Billy until his owner turns up and claims
him, and I am ready to fight the first boy who meddles or tries to take
him away from me.&#8221; This settled the matter, for Ned could whip
any of the boys in that gang.</p>

<p>Billy Jr. stayed with Ned for about a week and every day they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
had a race, or the boys played they were firemen and harnessed Billy
to their hook-and-ladder wagon and made him pull it to where they
played the fire was. After a day or two, Billy thought this was too
much like work; there was no fun in it for him, besides Hero would
not speak to him since he had beaten him in every race they had run,
so he decided to go away and look for another home.</p>

<p>It was three nights after this before he found a chance to slip out,
as he was shut in the stable every night in one of the box stalls. This
night the coachman forgot to latch the sliding door to his stall, so when
the man went to supper Billy pushed it open and slipped out into the
coach-house where, as luck would have it, he found the door open into
the alley, and out of it he went, not stopping or turning around until
he reached the stable where Hero lived. He would not have stopped
here, but Hero smelled goat as he passed and barked to Billy, &#8220;Is that
you, Billy Jr., out at this time of the night? You must be running
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, I am running away and I&#8217;m never coming back,
so good-bye, Hero; when I see you again I expect you can beat me,
for by that time I shall be so old that any dog can do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You impudent goat, I shall not wish you good luck after that
remark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy, chancing to look back down the alley, thought he saw a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
boy running in his direction and, for fear it might be Ned, he hurried
on and turned out of the alley into the first street he came to. He had
gone but a few feet when he saw one of the boys that always played
with Ned coming in his direction, so he dodged into the next alley
and hid behind a garbage box until the boy had crossed out of sight,
then he came out and began to look for some friendly stable that he
could enter. It was beginning to storm and soon the rain came down
in torrents. Vivid lightning flashes were followed by loud rumblings
of thunder, and although Billy was a hardy goat, still he was deathly
afraid of thunder storms. He quickened his pace, passing stable after
stable, but all were closed to keep out the rain and not even a back
yard gate was open so he could run in and get under a wood-shed or
porch.</p>

<p>It grew darker and darker each moment; the lightning became
more frequent and more vivid, until poor Billy was all in a tremble.
Suddenly he spied an over-turned packing box lying close to a stable,
with just room enough for him to squeeze in between. &#8220;Well, this
is better than nothing,&#8221; he thought, so he squeezed himself in and
was about to lie down when he heard a low growl, and the next flash
of lightning revealed to him another occupant of the box&mdash;a little
yellow dog with a stubby tail and blazing eyes.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapw.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WELL, what are you doing here?&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the question I was about to ask you,&#8221; replied the
dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came in to get out of the rain because all the other places were
shut,&#8221; said Billy Jr.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I came here because I live here. This is the only home I
know,&#8221; answered the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if that is the case I will be going, as I do not wish to intrude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are perfectly welcome to stay and share the shelter of my
home, poor as it is,&#8221; said the dog, whose name was Stubby.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are exceedingly kind,&#8221; replied Billy. &#8220;I will gladly stay
if only for your company. I hate being out alone in a thunder storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this they became very well acquainted and prolonged their
talk far into the night, exchanging confidences and experiences.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>As you all know Billy&#8217;s history, I will not repeat what he told
the dog, but will confine myself to the sad story of Stubby&#8217;s life.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p090.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Stubby was undoubtedly of common parentage with not a drop
of blue blood in his veins, but he had plenty of good red blood, so he
did not care, only he often
thought it would be very
nice to be petted and fed as
thoroughbreds were. This
wish, however, only came
on days when he had nothing
to eat but a piece of
mouldy bread from the
garbage box and nothing to
drink but water out of a
mud puddle. On other
days he would not exchange
his lot for that of a King
Charles lying on a satin cushion on my lady&#8217;s lap, for what did the
King Charles know of real life or freedom, shut up in my lady&#8217;s
boudoir, or taken for a walk at the end of a silver chain?</p>

<p>No, he would not change his free, roving life and home in a
packing box for all the satin cushions in the world. He felt that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
should sicken and die shut up in a home, fed on bonbons, and only
allowed to run to the length of a short chain. To be sure it must be
nice to have for a mistress a pretty lady who would stroke you with
her soft white hand, or a sweet little girl to romp and play with, but
one could not have these joys without the evils of being shut up in
an overheated house, and that he knew he could not stand.</p>

<p>He had been born under a barn standing in the suburbs of San
Francisco. His father he had never seen and his mother was a small
yellow dog like himself, only she had a tail that curled in a beautiful
manner once and a half times round, of which she was very proud.
His tail had curled in this same way until some bad boys caught
him and cut it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I tell you, Master Billy, you don&#8217;t know what it is to knock
around the world and be only a poor little yellow cur that every one
delights to kick and stone, although he has done nothing but mind
his own business. You see, though you have traveled a great deal
and seen more of the world than I have, still you have not bucked up
against its cruel side as I have. One reason is because you are so big
and so strong that people dare not hurt you, while as for me, I have
been so small and so homely that any bad boy or man could be cruel
to me and not be afraid of getting hurt for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had had my eyes open only for a few days when my mother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
told my brothers and sisters and me that if we wanted to get on in
the world we must not look for justice, or bite when we were abused,
and she said that we must endure all things, be patient and return
good for evil. I remember this talk distinctly because it was the
last we ever had with her, for the very next day a boy crawled under
the barn and took all my brothers and sisters and myself in a basket
and carried us to the river bank, where he tied a stone to each of our
necks and then threw us into the water to drown. Somehow, he did
not tie my string tight enough, and when he threw me into the river
the weight of the stone untied the string and let me loose, so when I
reached the bottom, instead of staying down like my brothers and
sisters, I came to the surface and then swam ashore. I never knew
I could swim until I found myself in the river, and then, instinctively,
I struck out as if I had been swimming all my life, just as all
animals do when thrown into the water for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I reached the shore the boy had gone, for when he saw
us disappear under the water he thought we would never come up.
I rested on the bank in the sun until I got dry, quietly crying for my
kind little mother, for I knew I never could find my way back to her.
I saw a house a short distance away with a barn and barnyard at the
back, so I crept under the fence into the back yard and went to sleep
beside a straw-stack. For supper I had only a little milk that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
lapped up from the ground where the girl had spilled it when milking.
Of course I got more dirt than milk, but I was afraid to go
nearer to the house for fear of being abused.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next morning the hired girl came out to milk the cow
and I made up my mind I would try to make friends with her, so I
commenced by giving a little low bark to attract her attention as she
sat milking. She turned around quickly and said, &#8216;My goodness,
how you scared me! Where did you come from, you poor forlorn
little thing?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her voice reassured me, so I ran straight up to her and she
patted me and said, &#8216;There, don&#8217;t look so frightened, no one is going
to hurt you.&#8217; When she went to the house she called to me to follow
her, which I was very glad to do, and she gave me a saucer of nice,
warm milk, which I was very much in need of, being both cold and
hungry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, from that day until I was stolen by a tin peddler, I
stayed there and was petted and fed as if I had been a dog with the
bluest of blue blood in my veins. But what a life I had of it with
that lying, cheating tinker, until he at last sold me for five dollars
to a young lady who had taken a fancy to me, mostly from pity, I
think. From this lady I learned many tricks and was dressed in a
blue blanket and tied with blue ribbons, which I tried to lose off or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
else rolled in the mud with, every chance I got. Some boys stole
me from her, finally, and they cut off my beautiful curly tail, the
only thing about me that was beautiful, although the young lady
used to say, &#8216;Stubby, you have the loveliest eyes I ever saw in a dog&#8217;s
head. They certainly look as if you had a human soul, and you
make me wonder what you are thinking about.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;After the boys stole me, my luck went from bad to worse until
I had to hide in the daytime and only look for food at night. I was
stoned and kicked so that at last I gave up trying to find a good
master or mistress and I hid in alleys, sometimes sleeping out in the
rain and cold without any shelter but the sky or anything softer than
a board to sleep on, so when this old packing box was thrown out
into the alley I hailed it with delight and have lived in it ever since.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see my story is only a pitifully uninteresting tale beside
your life history.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget the past,&#8221; said Billy Jr. &#8220;That is gone, and in the
future we will live together and see what good we can get out of life.
What do you say to leaving the city and going out into the country?
It is much cleaner there, while there is less chance of being abused
or of getting shut up where we won&#8217;t be free to come and go as we
please.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Stubby, &#8220;I am longing to get into the country
once again. What direction shall we take?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;South,&#8221; replied Billy Jr. &#8220;Let us try to find our way to Old
Mexico, where it is nice and warm the year round.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a splendid idea,&#8221; said Stubby. &#8220;I, too, am tired of the
cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too bad that dogs can&#8217;t live on grass and the things that
goats can, for then you would not have to go hungry so often. I
believe I could live on old shoes and straw if I could find nothing
else to eat, although I don&#8217;t say I should relish them much,&#8221; said
Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I can live on very little, so don&#8217;t worry about me,&#8221; said
Stubby.</p>

<p>At the first peep of dawn the two friends left the old packing
box and started on their long journey to Old Mexico.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SIX months later we find Billy Jr. and Stubby near the City
of Mexico, on a large stock-farm, where are raised fierce,
blooded bulls intended for the bull-fights that take place
every Sunday in the City.</p>

<p>It would take too long to tell of all the troubles and mishaps the
two friends met with on their long journey from San Francisco to
Old Mexico, but with all their trials they enjoyed it, for both were
good travelers and made the best of things without complaining
when matters could not be helped.</p>

<p>Once Stubby came very near getting drowned in a fierce mountain
stream that had become swollen from recent rains until it was
twice its usual size. Caught in one of the whirling eddies, he was
spun round and round until, dizzy and sick, he could not open his
eyes, and had not strength enough left to swim against the strong,
swift current. He was just giving up hope when he felt some large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
object strike his side and, opening his eyes for an instant, he saw
Billy Jr., who swam out to rescue him.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p097.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Climb on my back,
Stub,&#8221; Billy cried, &#8220;and I
will swim to shore with
you.&#8221; Stubby did as he was
bidden and soon they were
shaking themselves dry on
the bank.</p>



<p>Another mishap, one
in which Stubby was the
hero and saved Billy Jr.&#8217;s
life, occurred one moonlight
night out on the
plains. They were both
sound asleep when Stubby was suddenly awakened by hearing a
peculiar rattling sound and, looking about, he was horrified to see
a snake just ready to spring upon Billy, who was sleeping peacefully.
With a bound, Stubby had the reptile by the neck and in a
second had shaken him to death. In fact, he had given him such a
crack that the snake&#8217;s head nearly flew off. Small dogs have often
been known to kill snakes in this way. Billy Jr. was very much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
surprised when he awoke and saw a big snake lying under his very
nose. Stubby had dragged it there to see what Billy would do
when he saw it. Had it been alive Billy would surely have been
bitten, for he was too much surprised to move. He stared at it
with blinking eyes to see if his sight was not deceiving him. When
he discovered that it was really a snake he ducked his head and
hooked it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see that rattlesnake, Stubby? I had a pretty close
call, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so very,&#8221; said Stubby, &#8220;for dead snakes do not bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was no dead snake, for it was not there when I laid down,
and dead snakes do not crawl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right there, Billy Jr., but that snake was dead and I
ought to know, for I killed it and dragged it there just to scare you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you did, did you? and where did you find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found it about three feet from your head ready to spring upon
you, so I made a spring first and killed it before it had time to bite
you. After I killed it I put it under your nose for fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a brick, Stubby, that is what you are; a regular gold
brick, and I will not forget this in a hurry. I hope some day I shall
have a chance to do you a good turn or save your life.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t lay awake nights trying to think of some way to
help me, for you have already saved my life once, when you pulled
me out of the whirlpool,&#8221; said Stubby.</p>

<p>One day when they were trotting along the foot-hills of the
Sierra Madre mountains, tired and footsore, hungry and cold, feeling
thoroughly discouraged and as if they should never reach their destination,
they thought they saw a curl of blue smoke rising from the
base of one of the foot-hills in among some tall cacti.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Billy, look,&#8221; cried Stubby, who had been the first to see
it; &#8220;that smoke means some man is building a fire to cook his supper
by. I have seen a little curl of smoke like that before and it always
means that, at this time of the day. Let&#8217;s go and see if he won&#8217;t share
with us. I am so hungry for a piece of meat I feel as if I could
almost kill some one, if I had to, to get it, and I am so thin, I am
sure if you listened you could hear my ribs rattle. Raw prairie-dog
meat and roots are not very filling food for a dog, and I feel as if
the only thing I had had to eat since we left Frisco was those ground
bird eggs I sucked a week ago. You did not like them and said they
were too stale and that if I waited half an hour they would hatch
out and I could then have birds instead of eggs. You must be just
as hungry, for buffalo grass may sustain life but it is dry stuff to eat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
while the cacti leaves are juicy enough to eat, but the thorns on their
edges run into one&#8217;s nose and mouth and make them bleed.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Stubby had been doing all this talking, they had cautiously
approached the spot where they had seen the smoke rising
and soon the delicious odor of juicy steak was wafted to their nostrils
by the evening breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy, do you smell that steak? Don&#8217;t it smell better than
anything you ever smelt in your life before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, to tell you the truth, I would prefer carrots or turnips.
You forget I am not a meat eater. I am a vegetarian, but for all
that I can appreciate your feelings. Look between those two tall
cacti. There is an Indian as sure as I am alive!&#8221; said Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Great Black Bear!&#8221; said Stubby, &#8220;you are right and I
see my finish, for if I go nosing around here, they will catch me and
make soup of me in a twinkling.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p100a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">In the very Center Stood Little Duke.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear, Stubby. I know the Indians well. They are
fond of dogs and they never kill and eat them unless they are starving.
There is no danger of that now, for from the smell of cooking
meat which we get, they have evidently stolen a stray cow or steer
from some herd and are now cooking it whole over a camp-fire for the
entire band. There is too strong a smell to emanate from a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
piece, so if I am right you are in luck, and likely to have your fill
before the night is over. They only eat the best part of the animal
and throw the rest to their dogs.&#8221;</p>



<p>This proved to be the case and after the Indians had eaten their
fill, they rolled themselves in their blankets and went to sleep. Billy
and Stubby sneaked about and found the dogs at the feast. At first
these dogs were going to protest, but Billy called to them, &#8220;The first
one of you that yelps or objects to our helping ourselves I will rip
open with my horns.&#8221; As he looked big and fierce enough to carry
out this threat, they thought he meant what he said and so let him
and Stubby alone and fell to eating in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, go ahead, Stubby, and eat your fill, while I wander
around and see if I can&#8217;t find some sweet herbs, for the squaws generally
have a lot hanging outside of their wigwams drying, along
with sweet grass and onions. Oh, the very thought of onions makes
my mouth water! so good-bye for awhile, but if you should want me,
give the signal by three short barks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning the Indians were delighted to find a large
black goat and a smart, little yellow dog. They camped here for
some time, making baskets and blankets, and then started on their
way to the City of Mexico to sell their wares. Billy and Stubby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
stayed with them until they passed the stock-farm before mentioned
in this chapter, and then they left, made friends with the people on
the farm, and became a fixture there for some time.</p>

<p>They had been on this farm three months when the incident I
am about to relate happened.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p102.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Midnight Fire.</i></h2>
</div>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapo.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON THIS farm were large barns where the blooded horses
and bulls were housed at night, each in his own stall, and
over all were great hay mows where the hay and feed for
them were kept.</p>

<p>Billy was fastened in one of these stalls every night, because
previous to this he had eaten all the blossoms off the lemon tree, which
was the pride of the mistress; chewed the bosom out of his master&#8217;s
dress shirts for the starch that was in them; nibbled the trailing vines
off the hanging baskets on the front veranda; and chewed the sleeve
out of the cook&#8217;s new red calico wrapper that was hanging on a line
outside to dry. Stubby, however, was allowed to rove around at will,
but he always preferred to be locked up with Billy, as it was so lonesome
when left alone outside.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, on the night of the fire he preferred to
remain outside to gnaw on some bones he had hidden and to have a
talk with a little hairless Chihuahua dog that lived on the farm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Had it not been for this, Billy might have been burned to death and
this story brought to an untimely end, besides Stubby would have
lost the chance of making himself a hero.</p>

<p>It was near midnight. His feast and chat with the Chihuahua
dog were over and he was lying asleep just outside of Billy&#8217;s stall.
Suddenly he was awakened by something hot dropping on his head
and paw. Jumping up to find out what had hurt him, he saw flames
pouring out of the open windows of the hayloft, and as he looked the
frightened faces of two tramps appeared at the windows and then
disappeared, only to reappear at another window where there was
less fire. This window they climbed into and stood prepared to
jump, but hesitated before taking the risk from that height, until
the flames drove them off and they half jumped, half fell, to the yard
below, where they dropped uninjured upon a pile of straw. They
had scarcely landed when Stubby was after them, barking and biting
at their legs, while they took to their heels in double-quick time, glad
to get off the premises. Stubby did not follow them, for he knew
that he must hurry back and awaken the household so some one would
come and unlock the stall door where his beloved Billy was fastened.
He ran back to the barn and commenced to bark, telling Billy that
the barn was on fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it, Stubby. I have been smelling fire and smoke for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the last half hour, but did not know where it came from. My stall
is so dense with smoke I can&#8217;t see, and if it were not for this strong
rope around my neck I would be out of here, for I could easily butt
down the door, but this rope is as tough and strong as iron. I have
been chewing it ever since I smelt the smoke, but it still holds together.
I have pulled until my neck is nearly severed from my body
and still it won&#8217;t break or slip over my horns. The horses and cattle
are all in a panic and are snuffing and pawing like mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep on chewing, Billy, while I run to the house after help.
Everything is quiet there; the night watchman sneaked to the city
when every one went to bed and he has not returned, and at the house
all are fast asleep, never suspecting that their property is being destroyed
and their cattle in danger of cremation. Oh, why did the
watchman leave his post?&#8221; And Stubby literally flew to the house and
barked and barked, jumping against the door to make more noise and
calling to the little Chihuahua dog to help arouse the sleeping inmates.</p>

<p>Every minute the flames rose higher and higher and the blazing
building lit up the landscape for miles around. But the inmates slept
serenely. Stubby ran to the back of the house and upset a lot of
milk pails, knowing they would make a terrible clatter as they rolled
about on the stones, then back again he ran to his master&#8217;s door,
growling as before. At last a sleepy voice called out:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;If you are after a cat, let her alone and lie down; don&#8217;t arouse
the whole household with your noisy barking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At last I have awakened some one,&#8221; said Stubby, &#8220;and I shall
make more noise than ever,&#8221; so he ran toward the barn and back
again, barking furiously all the time, so that his master would know
something was wrong there, then he again went to the door and
growled and whined.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be something the matter or Stubby would not make
such a fuss,&#8221; said his master to his wife. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just get up and look
out of the window,&#8221; and as he raised the window shade the whole
room was flooded with the red glare of fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God! wife, the barn is on fire and I have been lying here
like a log while that noble dog has been trying to awaken me, and I
trying to drive him off, thinking he was chasing cats!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubby&#8217;s master only waited to step into a pair of trousers and
slippers before he followed Stubby on flying feet to the barn, just
stopping long enough on the way to ring the alarm bell that hung
on a high pole and could be heard all over the farm. This unusual
sound in the dead of night awoke all of the farm-hands, and they
came running along as fast as their feet could carry them, rubbing
their sleepy eyes, wondering what danger menaced them, for this
bell was never to be rung except in case of fire or danger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>One glance at the blazing barn drove all sleep from their eyes
and they rushed toward the fire; their one thought being to save the
horses and bulls; the bulls that were to fight in to-morrow&#8217;s fight
and which had been reared and fatted for this express purpose. Apart
from the great financial loss, it would spoil to-morrow&#8217;s sport for
thousands and thousands of Spaniards and Mexicans who were anxiously
awaiting the great event. These men, being Mexicans, did
not think it cruel to sacrifice bulls and horses and men even in these
fights, which are national affairs; but we think if the poor animals
knew what was awaiting them on the morrow, they would not have
tried so frantically to escape death by fire.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p108.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>As Stubby and his master were approaching the barn, one end of
the roof fell in&mdash;that end where Billy&#8217;s stall was, and on seeing this
Stubby gave a howl of despair; but the next second was blinking to
see if his eyes were not deceiving him, for who should come out of the
stall door with a bound but Billy! The goat had at last succeeded
in chewing his rope in two, and, that done, it was an easy matter to
butt down the door. Better yet, the bulls, seeing this opening, had
broken out of their stalls and were following Billy. The roof had
caught on some strong cross-beams and had not fallen on the cattle in
the stalls.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>Soon all the bulls were
out, but to get the horses out
was another matter, for, as
you know, horses will remain
in a burning building
in spite of everything, unless
you can cover their
heads and lead them out,
and even then it is a hard
matter to get them
to stay out. With the
help of all hands,
however, they succeeded
in saving the
horses, but none too
soon, for as the last
one was led out, the
whole barn crushed
in and a few minutes
more was nothing
but a red
heap of burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
timbers. Stubby&#8217;s master was so thankful for the escape of his
expensive horses and valuable bulls that he did not give the loss of
the barn a second thought, and when it was all over he called Stubby
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, do you see this little dog? Well, if it had not been for
him all my valuable stock would have been buried under that bed
of burning coals and I should have been a poor man, as all my
wealth is tied up in horses and cattle. It was he who awakened
me and gave the alarm of fire. For this he shall have a collar of
gold with this motto inscribed upon it, &#8216;<i>To Stubby for saving forty
lives this collar is affectionately dedicated by his master, Carlos
Otero.</i>&#8217; Stubby can always wear this collar as Billy does his, telling
of this brave deed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The night watchman, hearing what had happened through his
neglect, never came back, as he was too ashamed and afraid to face
his master.</p>

<p>Every one wondered how the barn caught on fire; some thought
the watchman had set it on fire, others thought one of the stable
boys had been careless about smoking and a spark from his pipe had
set fire to the hay; but no one but Stubby really knew about the two
tramps whose pipes had done all the mischief.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/dropcapt.jpg" alt="" />
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">TWO days after the fire all was bustle and confusion at the
farm, for this was the day of the long anticipated bull-fight
that was to occur in Mexico City and for which these especial
bulls had been raised and fattened. It was barely sunrise when
the little procession started for the city; the object in starting so soon
being to avoid the crowd of people anxious to view the bulls before
they reached the arena.</p>

<p>Billy Jr. and Stubby went along as a matter of course&mdash;they
must see everything going&mdash;and they had no intentions whatsoever
of missing the great fight, particularly as the odds were in favor of
their favorite bull. Our Billy knew thoroughbreds when he saw
them and could pick the winners. To-day&#8217;s favorite was strong of
bone, supple of joint, solid of flesh, with a quick eye and a temper
like a firecracker. He was handsome to look upon with his fine,
short, glossy black coat and beautifully curved horns with tips like
needles, that could pierce a horse&#8217;s skin and rip him open in the
approved Mexican style. His eyes were large and brilliant and his
nose with its sensitive nostrils as red as the cactus blossom of his
native country. And how he could bellow and paw the ground
when mad! Yes, Billy was sure he would win against all odds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>After they reached the city, he could hear the big bull stamping
around in his stall and bellowing for his breakfast. His royal highness
was not accustomed to be kept waiting, he was always fed on
the dot&mdash;just at sunrise, and here it was twelve o&#8217;clock and not a
bite, not even a whisp of hay. Had his master forgotten him? What
an outrage after his long walk in from the farm! What in the world
could be the meaning of such treatment? He little realized that
he was being starved for a purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what it is, Billy,&#8221; he grumbled, &#8220;if that crazy stable
boy don&#8217;t bring me something to eat soon, I&#8217;ll toss him over the
barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! what is that? I hear music. Don&#8217;t you? And the
rumble of many feet as the crowd of people take their places in the
amphitheatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Billy, the band is playing; it is almost time to
begin. Well, if I don&#8217;t get something to eat before very long I&#8217;ll
give them some sport worthy the name when I get into the arena.
Shut up in here, treated so badly, and starved to death&mdash;I&#8217;ll make
somebody pay well for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Billy, &#8220;they are clapping and stamping, impatient
for the fight to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t begin any too soon to please me,&#8221; said Little Duke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
which was the name of Billy&#8217;s favorite bull. &#8220;There goes Black
Jack on his way to the ring. Billy, just hear the crowd cheer and
shout! He must have stepped into the arena. He is a nasty one
to handle when he is angry. If he gets a chance to dig his horns
into one of those toreadors
or horses, the
man in the moon pity
them and have mercy
on them, for
Black Jack won&#8217;t! It
will be the last fight
that man or horse
ever sees.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i-p112.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Bull after bull
passed by their stall
on their way to the
arena, but none ever
returned; and the
band played and the
people cheered until
at last some one came
for Little Duke, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
flower of the flock. He, like the others, was led into the ring to be
teased and tantalized, tortured and tormented until, crazy with pain
and blind with fury, he would rip horse after horse open in his mad
rage to get at the toreador who was goading him on with pricks from
a long spear. And yet the blood-thirsty Mexicans yelled for more.</p>

<p>But all things must come to an end; and Billy thought that it
was high time for this particular fight to come to an end right here.
He had heard a bellow of rage from Little Duke, followed by a
groan of agony. This was too much for Billy. When a friend
called for help he could not stay away; so with one bound he was
out of his stall and bang! against the little door that separated him
from the arena. This gave way with a crash, and with a rush and
a plunge Billy bounded into the ring.</p>

<p>The first thing he saw when clear of splinters and dust was a
huge ampitheatre packed from the lowest to the highest row of
seats with people, until the faces made a human curtain. In the
arena lay disemboweled horses and slaughtered bulls. In the very
center stood Little Duke, bleeding from a hundred wounds, but still
unsubdued and defending himself nobly. There he stood with head
erect, eyes blazing, and nostrils quivering, ready to kill the first man
or horse that attacked him.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Billy took in the situation, and before the audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
or fighters knew what had happened, Billy had tossed one toreador
to one side, nearly breaking his back; had put another to flight;
and then made straight for the horseman who had so cruelly tortured
Little Duke. Just then an attendant opened a door, the man
and horse escaped, and the ring was cleared.</p>

<p>Billy, going back to see how badly Little Duke was hurt, licked
his nose in sympathy, and told him to brace up, for the fight was over
for that day. This pathetic scene seemed to touch even the hard
hearts of the Mexicans. They began to bid for the ownership of
the goat and to cheer and cheer until they could have been heard
many blocks from the amphitheatre.</p>

<p>At last Billy, perceived that he and his friend were standing
alone in the centre of the big ring with every eye upon them. The
next thing he noticed was that a little stubby-tailed yellow dog
was circling round and round them, barking in great glee. The
fight was over and Stubby had come to congratulate them.</p>

<p>Here ends the great bull-fight of the ninth of May, nineteen
hundred and four.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AN hour after the bull-fight was over, Billy and Stubby could
have been seen running first down one street, then down
another, then through an alley, and lastly through the suburbs,
leaving a cloud of dust behind them. They were running
away from their master and his men who were trying to drive
them back to the farm, but Billy and Stubby decided they did not
want to return since all their friends, the bulls, but Little Duke whose
life Billy had saved, had been killed.</p>

<p>They kept running until they were sure they could not be overtaken
and then they stopped for breath and to decide where they
wanted to go next. While nibbling the leaves from a bush, Billy,
chancing to look up, saw straight ahead of him, looming up above
trees and housetops, a high mountain out of which a column of smoke
was curling like a black plume against the clear, blue sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! Stubby, see what a big bon-fire there is on that mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t a bon-fire,&#8221; said Stubby. &#8220;That is a volcano and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
name is Popocatapetl. It sounds as if they were saying, poke-a-cat-with-a-paddle.
I expect someone at sometime poked a cat with a
paddle on that mountain and that is how it got its name, something
after the manner of the Indians who give their children the name
of the first thing the mother sees after they are born. I suppose the
chiefs Blackhawk and Whitehorse got theirs in that way, as for
Mud-in-the-face, some one must have thrown mud in the mother&#8217;s
face at the critical moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Stubby! You are too funny for anything. Where did you
learn so much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! from listening to what the people were saying round me
when I was out with my master.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a very observing dog and it would be a good thing
if more people followed your example, then they would learn a
great deal even if they never went to school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far do you suppose it is to that volcano?&#8221; asked Stubby.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. I have given up guessing distances
in this locality or in any mountainous country. That reminds me,
did you ever hear the story of the joke on the Englishman who came
to Colorado Springs and started to walk to the mountains he saw
back of the hotel, thinking he could reach them and return before
breakfast? I know you have for every one has.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;Go ahead and tell it. I want to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These mountains proved to be over a hundred miles away,
though they looked only five. So the next day when he went for a
walk, coming to a little stream, that one could easily step over, he
instead sat down and commenced taking off his shoes and stockings
to the surprise of his friend who was with him who asked what he
was doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was fooled on your distances yesterday, but I won&#8217;t be to-day.
This may look like a narrow stream, but if I try to step over, it will
broaden out and prove to be a river, so I&#8217;m getting ready to wade
across.&#8221;</p>

<p>This story made Stubby roll over on his back and fairly howl
with mirth, not only because it was funny but because he had heard
it told a hundred times and no two people had told it in the same
way, and he wanted to hear how Billy would tell it.</p>

<p>The cunning Stubby took good care not to let Billy know that
he had ever heard the story before, for good friends as they were,
Billy might not like to be made fun of, besides his horns were sharp.</p>

<p>Stubby&#8217;s rolls and laughter were cut short by hearing a great
clatter of horses&#8217; hoofs on the hard road behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry and hide, Billy. It must be a party of Mexicans racing
on their way home from the Bull-fight.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>Stubby was right. They were Mexican cow-boys out on a lark.
When they saw Billy&#8217;s head sticking above the bushes, one said in
broken Spanish, &#8220;Now for some fun,&#8221; at the same time unfastening
his lasso from the pummel on his saddle where it always hung and
with a twirling tongue, uttered this cry &#8220;Cha-r-r-r-ah!&#8221; He swung
the lasso three times round his head and as he did so the loop widened
and lengthened until with a hissing sound it descended, encircling
Billy&#8217;s neck and the next second he was jerked over the bush he was
hiding behind and dragged at a fast run after the cow-boy who was
spurring his pony to catch up with those who were ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well! Carlos, what have you there?&#8221; called one of the boys,
when he saw him dragging Billy behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a dandy billy-goat. Now you fellows see what you
can lasso and when we get back to the ranch we will raffle off what
we catch or cook them for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you Carlos. That will be sport. There, I see something
now I&#8217;m going to lasso,&#8221; meaning Stubby, who was following
after Billy as fast as he could, for he would have followed Billy into
the jaws of death, if need be.</p>

<p>Poor Stubby was very much surprised to feel a rope tighten
around his neck and the next minute to feel himself lifted from the
ground to the saddle before the cow-boy where he was held as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
galloped on in their mad race toward the ranch where the cow-boys
lived.</p>

<p>It is astonishing what some cow-boys can do with a lasso and
how expert they may become in its use.</p>

<p>Presently, one of the boys spied a big turkey-buzzard sitting on
top of a cactus-plant and with a whoop like an Indian, he was after it.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Buzzard had time to spread his wings and fly, he
felt something hot twist around his neck, and the last thing he heard
in this world was a merry laugh go up from the cow-boys at the
idea of lassoing instead of shooting birds.</p>

<p>The cow-boy was going to throw his buzzard away but the
others told him to bring it along as every one was to show, when he
got back, what he had caught with his lasso.</p>

<p>Soon a terrible squealing was heard just ahead where one of
the cow-boys had ridden, and when the others caught up to him
they found he had succeeded in lassoing a brown and sandy-colored
pig.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for you Jake. Now we will have some roast pork and
goat chops for supper and we will throw the bones to the turkey-buzzard.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not know then that the big buzzard&#8217;s neck was broken.</p>

<p>They were now so near the ranch, it began to look as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
some of the boys would fail to find anything to lasso, and they had
agreed that those who had not succeeded in getting anything by the
time they reached the ranch should clean and cook whatever had
been caught.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be switched if I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; said a great, tall cow-boy.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll find something or die.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, his eyes detected a gray something sneaking
away behind some rocks, so he gave chase, not knowing what it was
going to be. When this gray object heard his pony&#8217;s hoofs on the
stone, it got frightened and left its hiding place behind a great
boulder and took to its heels. Whizz! went the lasso, but instead
of catching the wolf, for that is what it was, it coiled around the
boulder, and the wolf had several leaps and strides the advantage.
His failure to catch the wolf the first time, only made the cow-boy
the more determined to have it at all costs in the end, and then the
chase began: Over the rocks, round clumps of cacti, across ditches,
the cow-boy steadily gaining, until with one long, mighty sweep of his
arm the lasso stretched out and fell over the gray wolf&#8217;s head and
he was captured.</p>

<p>Then like Billy, he was made to trot along behind the cow-boy&#8217;s
pony until they came into the corral at the ranch. Once there,
the cow-boys threw their saddles and bridles up on pegs in the stable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
and turned their ponies loose in the corral with a bunch of alfalfa
to feed on. And now for the fun of seeing the boys, who failed to
lasso anything, clean and cook the pig and goat. A coin was tossed
to see which should be killed first. The head stood for the goat
and the tail for the pig. The coin was flipped and up came tail so
it was poor piggy&#8217;s fate to be killed first.</p>

<p>While two of the boys went to get a big iron kettle to boil water
to scald him with, so they could scrape the bristles off, the others
thought they would have some fun teasing Billy, but little did they
suspect that their goat was the same goat they had seen that afternoon
at the Bull-fight, clear the entire ring of horses, riders and
toreadors, or they would not have been so anxious to tease him.</p>

<p>Billy bleated to Stubby to stay near him as he was going to
watch his chance to jump the wall of the corral and make his escape
before they had time to kill him and cut him up into goat chops.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to appear very gentle until they take this lasso off
my neck and then we will see &#8216;Who is who and what is what.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubby barked back &#8220;All right, I will watch you and if you get
into a fight, I will help you by biting the legs of whoever bothers
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Sam, that is too nice a looking goat to cut up into chops.
I say we keep him and turn him loose with our goats on the range.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Come here Mr. Billy and I will take the lasso off your neck.&#8221; He
walked up to Billy and slipped the lasso off, giving his whiskers a
parting pull. That settled it. Billy&#8217;s docility disappeared in a
minute and before the cow-boy had taken a step he felt something
sticking into him as if he had sat down on two darning needles and
these needles were pushing farther and farther into him and urging
him along at a fast trot until he felt a sudden boost and he found
himself sitting on top of the corral wall, while the black goat landed
on the other side followed by a little stubby-tailed yellow dog and
both disappeared down a deep ravine and were lost sight of, and
what is more, no one followed them or tried to bring them back.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">AS soon as Billy and Stubby were sure they were not being
followed they stopped to rest and to form new plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stubby, what in the world are you carrying in your
mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dropping it so that he could answer, Stubby replied, &#8220;A nice,
large piece of beef.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beef! Where did you get any beef, I should like to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see I can&#8217;t live on grass and roots as you can and as
I was pretty hungry, I took my chance of getting stoned and stole
this piece as we ran by the smoke-house. Didn&#8217;t you notice the little
house in the clump of bushes near the side of the corral wall?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I did not see it, or know that you were behind me until
just now, for you did not bark, and I expected I would have to wait
awhile for you to join me, but now I see that you had your mouth so
full you could not bark. You go ahead and make a good supper
of your steak and I will make mine of these tender, green leaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they ate they talked of their future and Billy said he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
getting tired of Mexico as it had too much sand, cacti and other
stickly plants and not enough water and grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I say, we get out of it as soon as we can, but how we are
going to do that is a puzzle to me, for it seems to me the further we
travel south from California the hotter it gets, and I say instead of
traveling south as we have been doing, that we change our course
and keep to the west. In that way we will come to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we get there we can follow the shore until we come to
some town or city where we can take an ocean steamer and be carried
away anywhere. Who cares where? just so that we get away
from this hot, dusty country. Besides, I am very anxious for another
ocean voyage and always have been since Day and I came from Constantinople.</p>

<p>&#8220;My! Stubby, how I should like to see my sweet little sister
and dear father and mother again. And would it not be strange if
we should happen to get on a ship bound for Boston? I can tell you,
if we should have such luck I would not let the grass grow under my
feet until I was back on the farm again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you are homesick,&#8221; said Stubby.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t blame you for I, too, would be homesick if I had
ever had a home with a sister and dear parents in it, but you see I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
have never known what it was to have a home or any one to care for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just see how that old volcano is smoking now, and what a
bright reflection it throws on the sky above it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is due west from here. What do you say to our going to
the top of it and seeing what a volcano really does look like at close
range? It may be our only chance to see one for they don&#8217;t have any
in the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say we do, and perhaps, it is so high, we can see the ocean
from its top. We shall then be able to see how far we have to travel
before reaching the coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a good idea and we will follow it out. Now let us lie
down here and spend the night and start early in the morning before
the sun gets too hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ten minutes later they were both asleep with Stubby curled
up under Billy&#8217;s nose. He always got as close to him as possible
for company.</p>

<p>It took our travelers several days to reach the volcano and its
summit, and those days were days of hardships, with little to eat or
drink, and both were looking tired and thin when we met them
again within a few feet of the opening of the crater.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I think sight-seeing is pretty hard work, especially when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
you have to walk all the way and nearly die of thirst and hunger.
These hot cinders and hardened lava are burning and cutting my
feet all to pieces and I wish I had hoofs like yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you wish you had my hoofs, I wish I had your short
hair, for I am almost suffocated with my long coat, besides the air
in this altitude is hard to breathe. One gets out of breath so easily
and feels as if there was nothing to the air. Phew! what&#8217;s that terrible
odor? It smells as if a whole factory of sulphur matches had
gone off at once. Hark! What is that rumbling noise? It sounds
like thunder, but it can&#8217;t be that for the sky is without a cloud and
is as blue as blue can be. Say, Stubby, did you feel the earth shake
then? If we were down on the level I should think it were an earthquake.
Gracious! did you hear that explosion and feel the earth
shake again? We had better get out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the smoke rolled away for a minute and they saw
they were within a few feet of the top so they decided they would
not give up, bad as the sulphur and smoke were, until they had taken
one peep into the crater.</p>

<p>This one peep nearly cost Stubby his life, for just as he had
crawled to the very brink and was looking down, down, down into
the very bowels of the earth where lava was boiling and steam hissing,
an extra whiff of sulphur arose from the boiling, seething mass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
below which choked and strangled him so he could not move.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p127.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Billy had jumped back barely in time to escape it and was just
starting on a run down the cone away from this dangerous place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
when he heard a little whine and saw Stubby drop over on his side
as if dead. With a bound Billy was back, and grabbing him by
the nape of his neck, as a cat carries her kittens, he carried him
down the volcano&#8217;s side to safety.</p>

<p>It took Stubby a long while to come to and when he did so he
found his poor little torn and bleeding feet as well as his nose resting
in the cool sands of a little stream, and all he had to do, if he
wanted a drink, was to stick out his tongue and let the water run
through his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Stubby, are you feeling better?&#8221; he heard Billy say
when he tried to open his eyes to see where he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world did I get here? Can you tell me that? for I
had given up the hope of ever getting off that hot volcano again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I can, for I carried you every step of the way in my
mouth, and when I got here I thought every tooth in my head would
drop out, and instead of the little light weight dog I started with, I
thought I was carrying an elephant, you got so heavy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, old fellow, you are a brick. That&#8217;s what you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day Stubby was all right, and noticing that this little
stream flowed toward the west, they followed it for two reasons.
One, because they thought it would eventually run into the ocean;
and the other, because they were afraid to leave it for fear of not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
finding any more water, and it was impossible to travel in this dry,
hot country without having lots of water.</p>

<p>This little stream proved a perfect godsend to them as it
quenched their thirst, cooled their aching feet and bodies and saved
them many a long climb as it always kept its course and flowed
straight on.</p>

<p>Had they followed the mountain trail it would have led them
up hill and down and over many stones and brambles. Now, when
they came to a precipice that shut off their path by its steep side
they took to the stream and either waded or swam around it. In
this way they reached the seashore days before they had expected
to and with happy eyes they looked over the peaceful, blue bosom
of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stubby, I feel as if I had escaped from prison to get out of
that lonesome country full of insects, snakes and centipedes. Oh!
how refreshing this salt breeze smells.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I smell something sweeter to doggie nostrils and that&#8217;s
the smell of frying meat. There must be a fisherman&#8217;s cottage
around that bend. Good-bye, I&#8217;m off for some of it, and I mean to
have some, even if I have to steal it from the red hot stove.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in such a hurry and I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you had better stay here. You are so big they will see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
you, while I am little and so near the color of the sand that I can
sneak in and not be seen, and after finding out who lives there and
getting a piece of meat, I will come back and tell you all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, but bring me back a bunch of carrots or a cabbage
if you find any for I am as tired of eating leaves as you are of going
without meat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubby crept cautiously round the bend and then laid down
behind a bush out of sight so that he could watch and see who lived
in the house. On the doorstep sat a stoop-shouldered man smoking
a stubby pipe, while in front of him on the sand played three or
four little children, bare-headed, bare-footed, with only faded calico
slips on.</p>

<p>Through the open door Stubby could see the wife and mother
leaning over the stove cooking, yes, he knew it by the smell, the selfsame
steak he was longing for. He sneaked cautiously and quietly
round to the back of the cottage and there&mdash;Oh, be joyful&mdash;he spied
the remnants of the heifer that had been killed so that the family
could have a taste of fresh meat, which was as great a treat to them
as to Stubby, for they generally lived on salt meat and fish, which
the father caught, for he was a fisherman, and took to a little town
ten miles up the coast for shipment to large cities.</p>

<p>After Stubby had eaten all he wanted of the fresh meat he ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
back to Billy and told him there was a small garden of vegetables
back of the cottage where he could go as soon as it was dark and
have a feast.</p>

<p>The tired, sleepy heads of the fisherman and his family had
hardly touched their pillows when a large, black goat could have
been seen in the midst of a vegetable garden, eating cabbages, turnips
and lettuce, while a little yellow dog sat on a brown speckled
rock and licked his chops after a meal of fresh beef and cold boiled
potatoes he had found just inside the kitchen door, nicely chopped
for breakfast.</p>

<p>Presently Stubby gave a sudden, sharp bark of alarm which
made Billy throw up his head to see what was the matter, when
what should he see but the rock Stubby was sitting on, walk off with
four legs with a queer flat head sticking out from one side. Stubby
jumped off in a hurry and was nearly bitten in two by a quick snap
of the jaws of this queer looking beast, bird or fowl. They did not
know which to call it as they had never before seen or heard of a
snapping turtle, and that is what this was. Stubby had taken its
shell for a large stone, as it had its head and feet drawn in out of
sight when he jumped upon it.</p>

<p>This turtle was a huge one that the fisherman had caught the
day before and was going to take to town in the morning to sell to a
hotel-keeper to make turtle soup of.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>The next morning Billy and Stubby kept out of sight until the
fisherman had loaded his wagon with fish, vegetables and his turtle,
and had started on his way to town. Then they ran out of their
hiding place and followed him, taking great care to keep out of
sight and in this way they soon came to the seaport town and followed
him down to the wharf. When they reached the town they
both walked under the wagon so that people would think that they
belonged to the fisherman and would let them alone.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the wharf where lay a vessel ready to sail
for San Francisco, the fisherman got off his wagon to unload and
then, for the first time, he spied Billy and Stubby who were still
under it and he was very much surprised to see them there I can
tell you.</p>

<p>One of the sailors said, &#8220;What will you take for your goat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without letting on that Billy was not his or that he had never
laid eyes on him before, he said, &#8220;Well! as he is pretty fine, big
goat, I can&#8217;t let you have him for less than five dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. It&#8217;s a go,&#8221; said the sailor, who had lots of money
at present, having just received his pay and not having had a chance
to spend it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will you take for the dog?&#8221; asked another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know as I care to sell him,&#8221; said the fisherman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
thinking if he held off they would give him more money.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect to get much for him,&#8221; said another. &#8220;He
is too tarnation homely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a matter of taste,&#8221; drawled the fisherman. &#8220;Looks ain&#8217;t
everything in this world, and you can&#8217;t find a smarter rat dog along
this coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw this remark in for he knew it would catch the sailor
as the ships are always infested with rats.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll give you a dollar for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t think of selling him so cheap,&#8221; and he climbed
into his wagon, as if he were going off and did not care to part with
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you two dollars and a half, and not a cent more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to sell him, but as he has cleaned out all the rats
at my place I guess I&#8217;ll let you have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailors gave him the money for the goat and the dog, and
he drove off a happy man, but he did not let the grin show on his
face until he was out of sight of the sailors.</p>

<p>Now this was a great streak of luck for Billy and Stubby, and
was just what they wanted, so they followed their new masters on
board without giving any trouble and by night their ship had sailed
out of port and was on her way to San Francisco.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>An Unexpected Trip.</i></h2>
</div>


<div>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">AFTER an uneventful trip, they sailed one day into the beautiful
harbor of San Francisco, called the Golden Gate, and
Billy and Stubby were looking forward to a good time on
shore, and planning what they would do, when, all unexpectedly,
after landing, they got mixed up in a bunch of cattle, and
were driven aboard a big boat that was being loaded with live cattle
for Japan, and try as he would, Billy could not extricate himself from
them or avoid the long whips of the men who were driving them.
As for Stubby, he could easily have slipped away, but he preferred to
follow Billy, and that is how our travelers found themselves bound
for Japan without a day&#8217;s rest on shore after they came up the coast
from Mexico to San Francisco.</p>

<p>This was not at all what they wanted, for they were tired of the
ocean, but they were helpless, and what was worse, Billy stood in
danger of being killed and sold for mutton chops, for goat chops are
often sold for such. Stubby was afraid he, too, would be killed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
made into sausage, for he had heard that the Chinese eat dog meat,
and if they did, why not the Japanese? So with heavy hearts they
saw the shore recede farther and farther from them and the Golden
Gate sink into the blue waters of the Pacific, leaving them nothing
to look at but water, water all around them.</p>

<p>The only thing that varied the monotony of the long trip to Japan
was their short stop at the Sandwich Islands, where Billy and Stubby
were taken ashore for a run by the cook and his assistant, who were
both Japanese and were returning home to fight for their country
against Russia.</p>

<p>Since starting they had made great pets of both Billy and Stubby
and had often given them meat and apples, and got permission for
them to run on deck once in a while. Otherwise they would have
been shut below with the cattle and the trip would have been unendurable
to the independent, free-roving Billy.</p>

<p>One dark night as the steamer was ploughing the waters and
they were laying in a little sheltered nook on deck, they heard the
captain say to the mate:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are getting pretty near Port Arthur now and it is going to
be mighty ticklish sailing in these waters; with the two armies, the
Russians and the Japanese, banging away at each other from their
battleships and the waters under us filled with hidden mines and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
torpedo boats. I tell you, I don&#8217;t like these submarine things floating
around. Who knows but one might get loose, float off and perhaps
blow up the wrong boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>And that is just what did happen, for while the captain was
talking, a terrific explosion was heard, louder than one hundred
cannons going off at once, and for a second, the heavens were lit up
with a weird light in which were seen huge pieces of debris flying
in the air like the eruption from a volcano, while, almost in the same
second, they began falling with a sissing sound into the waters beneath,
and all that was left of the Russian&#8217;s battle ship was a few
splinters of wood and the mangled bodies of her officers and men
floating on top of the water.</p>

<p>It had all been so sudden and was over so quickly that it was
hard to realize that such a terrible disaster could have occurred in so
short a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what did I tell you about the danger of sailing along
here? One of these submarine mines or torpedo boats caused the
blowing up of that war-ship and I tell you what, we had better get
out of here as fast as ever we can or we too may be blown sky high
before we know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Consequently, they cautiously and softly steamed away from
Port Arthur and kept a sharp lookout for every Russian boat that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
might be sailing round looking for some boat of the enemies to capture,
but they escaped them all.</p>

<p>When they landed, Billy&#8217;s and Stubby&#8217;s friends, the Japs, took
them home with them where they were fed and nicely housed in their
back yard, and while Billy and Stubby were making friends with the
beautiful pheasants that were shut in the same yard, their Japanese
friends went to military headquarters to join the army and when they
came back they were dressed in their uniforms with orders in their
pockets to report at headquarters the next morning.</p>

<p>For several days after this, Billy and Stubby saw nothing of
them but they were fed and looked after by a pretty, rosy faced, little
Jap girl who wore a pretty flowered kimona and wore her hair in
funny looking, little, smooth puffs with toy fans sticking out of it.</p>

<p>They had been in the yard about a week and Billy was getting
tired of such close quarters with nothing to see or do, when he heard
a military band marching down the street on the other side of the
high fence. The little Jap girl who had just brought them some
water, when she heard this, dropped her pan and ran to the gate in
the fence and looked out to see the soldiers go by. Of course Billy
turned and was through the gate in a flash with Stubby close at his
heels and down the street they ran in the direction the band had taken,
while the poor little Jap girl ran after them wringing her hands in
dismay and calling to them to come back, but they only ran the faster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i-p138.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Billy was as bad as any little Irish Paddy about liking to follow
a parade or a band and when he caught up to it he found it was leading
a regiment that was marching to the front. When Billy and
Stubby dropped back to the rear who should they see but their Japanese
friends, the last men of the last ranks.</p>

<p>When Billy spied them he made up his mind in a twinkle to
follow and go to the war with them. This he bleated to Stubby and
of course Stubby thought it would be great fun and agreed to go, too.</p>

<p>When the regiment had left the city&#8217;s cheering crowds behind,
Billy and Stubby crept up closer to the soldiers and trudged on
quietly after them until Stubby gave a quick little bark which one of
the Japs recognized and turning his head, he saw with surprise Billy
and Stubby marching behind him.</p>

<p>He tried to drive them back by shooing them and scolding but
what cared Billy and Stubby for a shoo or a scold when they were
going to the war. As the Japs could not break ranks and go for the
goat and the dog, they had to let them follow, which they did, mile
after mile until the regiment broke ranks for the night and went
into camp.</p>

<p>By that time, they had traveled too far to send them back, so that
night when the Japs threw themselves down by their camp-fire, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
large black goat and a little yellow dog lay down with them.</p>

<p>And for many days and weeks and months they did this, sticking
to the regiment whether it chanced to be in the thick of the fight or
waiting for marching orders, and strange as it may seem, whenever
this regiment was in a fight, it always won and the two Japs had
fought so bravely that they had been promoted until they were no
longer privates but were colonel and captain, and their regiment was
known as the &#8220;Black Goat and Yellow Dog Regiment,&#8221; while Billy
and Stubby had become their mascots and here we will leave them to
enjoy their honors.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
